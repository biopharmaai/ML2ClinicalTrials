      Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2) has caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness described as
      COVID-19.

      Individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease develop a more severe illness and have
      higher rates of death.

      Because of the potential interaction between RAS blockers and SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of
      infection, there are ongoing scientific discussions on whether they should be stopped or
      continued in patients with COVID-19.

      It is crucial to determine whether RAS blockers should be discontinued or not in patients
      with COVID-19.

      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) describes a common medical condition in men over 45
      associated with voiding (obstructive) and storage (irritative) lower urinary tract symptoms
      and is in part related to prostate enlargement and obstruction. The standard medical therapy
      for this condition includes 5-alpha reductase inhibitors -5ARI (eg dutasteride) or alpha
      blocker therapy (eg tamsulosin), while the most effective medical therapy for BPH is the
      combination of these two medications. Approximately 10 to 20% of patients diagnosed with BPH
      also have either a diagnosis of or symptoms of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain
      syndrome (CP/CPPS) with typical genito-urinary pain and discomfort. This particular subset of
      patients of BPH patients with prostatitis symptoms pose a therapeutic dilemma. CP/CPPS (organ
      specific phenotype) is the third most prevalent prostate disease after prostate cancer and
      BPH. CP/CPPS is very prevalent (3-9% of men) and represents a significant percentage of
      urology outpatients (3-8% of male outpatient visits)resulting in a major impact on quality of
      life of patients and economic costs to society. Clinical phenotyping allows for prediction of
      the patients with CP/CPPS most likely to respond to dutasteride and tamsulosin (age, Lower
      Urinary Tract Symptoms [LUTS] and prostate related phenotypes [BPH]). It can be estimated

      Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) describes a common medical condition in men over 45
      associated with voiding (obstructive) and storage (irritative) lower urinary tract symptoms
      and is in part related to prostate enlargement and obstruction [1]. The standard medical
      therapy for this condition includes 5-alpha reductase inhibitors -5ARI (eg dutasteride) or
      alpha blocker therapy (eg tamsulosin), while the most effective medical therapy for BPH is

      with BPH also have either a diagnosis of or symptoms of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic
      pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) with typical genito-urinary pain and discomfort [3,4,5]. This
      particular subset of patients of BPH patients with prostatitis symptoms pose a therapeutic
      dilemma [6].

      CP/CPPS (organ specific phenotype) is the third most prevalent prostate disease after
      prostate cancer and BPH. CP/CPPS is very prevalent (3-9% of men) [7,8] and represents a
      significant percentage of urology outpatients (3-8% of male outpatient visits) [9,10]
      resulting in a major impact on quality of life of patients [11] and economic costs to society
      [12].

      There are no good evidence based therapies for CP/CPPS [13,14], although there is some
      evidence available to consider 5 alpha reductase inhibitor and alpha blocker therapies [22].
      There is an enormous unmet need to evaluate potential therapies for this condition.

      Our current understanding of CP/CPPS patients are that they are a heterogeneous group of
      unique patients (the ""snow flake"" hypothesis) presenting with different clinical phenotypes
      [15]. We have proposed [16,17], validated [18] and recently proved that clinical phenotyping
      (using our UPOINT classification system) is possible and provides more effective treatment
      strategies [19].

      There are studies that suggest that the same medical therapy that has proven effective for
      the treatment of BPH would also be beneficial for prostatitis like symptoms as well. A number
      of small pilot studies with finasteride [20], including a contemporary 6 month RCT [21], have
      strongly suggested that 5 ARI therapy may be effective in patients with CP/CPPS, but these
      studies were limited by study design including inclusion of all patients with the diagnosis
      of CP/CPPS (ages and clinical phenotypes that we now know could not possibly benefit from a
      5ARI). REDUCE and many other epidemiology studies, have documented that men over 45 years old
      suffer from prostatitis and prostatitis symptoms [23]. REDUCE also clearly shows that
      dutasteride favorably impacts on prostatitis-like symptoms and men with prostatitis-like
      syndrome enrolled in that study [24]. In fact, the potential benefits suggested by
      extrapolating REDUCE results far outweigh any other intervention we have evaluated in any of
      the large North American NIH sponsored RCTs in the last decade [25,26,27]. A further
      sub-analyses of REDUCE shows that men with IPSS ≥ 8 and enlarged prostates (eg BPH) have a
      significant symptom benefit with dutasteride, irregardless of prostate size [28].These
      initial findings in REDUCE in patients not specifically diagnosed with CP/CPPS should be
      expanded to examine the benefits in a CP/CPPS population.

      There are more clinical trials evaluating alpha blockers than any other therapy in CP/CPPS
      [22, 29]. While two North American RCTs [25,26] did not show benefit, 6 other alpha blocker
      randomized placebo controlled trials using validated contemporary outcomes were positive in
      terms of measureable benefits [30-35]. The latest clinical trial confirming the benefits of
      alpha blocker therapy in selected CP/CPPS patients (approximately 50 patients per arm in 12
      week study) was recently published [35] and showed benefit, primarily in the LUTS symptom
      domain.

      Clinical phenotyping allows for prediction of the patients with CP/CPPS most likely to
      respond to dutasteride and tamsulosin (age, Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms [LUTS] and prostate
      related phenotypes [BPH]). It can be estimated that up to 30% of men currently diagnosed with
      CP/CPPS will include men with co-existing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)

      In an open-label parallel groups blinded-endpoint randomized clinical trial, the
      investigators aim to assess the safety and efficacy of conventional catheter-directed
      thrombolysis (CDT) vs anticoagulation monotherapy on outcomes of patients with acute
      intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism. The investigators hypothesize that CDT will have a
      superior efficacy and safety compared with anticoagulation-only therapy regarding the
      proportion of patients with a right ventricle to left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio > 0.9 at a
      3-month follow-up by an imaging core laboratory, major bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia, or
      vascular access complication.

      Treatment of intermediate risk PE is still debated. Despite the promising results of small
      studies on the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolytic therapy, larger trials failed to
      show a net clinical benefit. Pulmonary EmbolIsmTHrOmbolysis (PEITHO) trial which compared the
      full-dose systemic thrombolysis (i.e., tenecteplase) versus anticoagulation therapy in
      patients with intermediate-risk PE showed significant lower incidence of mortality or
      hemodynamic collapse in the first 7 days after randomization in patients who received
      tenecteplase (2.6% vs 5.6% in placebo group, [odds ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.23
      to 0.87; P value, 0.02]). However the mortality benefit was neutralized by the increased risk
      of major bleeding in thrombolytic arm (11.5% vs 2.4% in the tenecteplase and placebo group,
      respectively. Importantly, during the long-term follow up (median of 37.8 months) of PEITHO
      participants, the thrombolytic therapy failed to improve the RV right ventricular function,
      residual dyspnea ( 36% in thrombolysis group vs 30.1% in the placebo group), or mortality
      rates (20.3% in thrombolysis group vs 18 % in the placebo group ). CTEPH occurred in ( 2.1%
      in thrombolysis group vs 3.2% in the placebo group. The lack of benefit of full-dose
      thrombolytic in PEITHO, might have several explanations. Intermediate risk PE compose of
      heterogenous group of patients with different prognosis in whom one fits all approach would
      not be applicable. This heterogeneity in prognosis were underlined in the latest guideline of
      the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) which classified the intermediate-risk PE category
      into two groups of intermediate-low and intermediate-high risk patients according to the
      right ventricle function and cardiac biomarker levels. Second, lower-dose thrombolytic
      regimen might result in the same benefit with lower bleeding events. CDT, by delivering drug
      locally, claims to increase the efficacy of thrombolytic agents and consequently decrease the
      required dose which might translate to lower bleeding events.

      In an open-label parallel groups blinded-endpoint randomized clinical trial, we aim to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of standard catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) vs
      anticoagulation-only therapy in patients with acute intermediate-high risk pulmonary
      embolism. The hypothesis is that CDT will have a superior efficacy and safety regarding the
      proportion of patients with a RV/LV ratio > 0.9 at a 3-month follow-up assessed by an imaging
      core laboratory with the lower complications of major bleeding, severe thrombocytopenia, and
      vascular access complication.

      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potent immunotherapy with
      curative potential for several hematological disorders. Improvements in survival following
      allo-HSCT have led to its increasing use, but the leading cause of non-relapse mortality
      (NRM) remains graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD. Despite recent advances in the understanding
      of transplantation immune tolerance, aGVHD is a frequent and major complication of allo-HSCT
      involving activation of donor T-lymphocytes, which ultimately causes host tissue damage.
      T-Guard has a rapid onset, preferential killing of activated T cells, and short half-life,
      leading to depletion of allo-reactive T cells and quick post-treatment reconstitution of the
      immune system.

    ",Trial of Supplemental Parenteral Nutrition in Under and Over Weight Critically Ill Patients (TOP-UP),"['Critical Illness', 'Acute Respiratory Failure']","['Respiratory Insufficiency', 'Overweight', 'Critical Illness']","
      Background

      Critically ill patients are often hypermetabolic and can rapidly become nutritionally
      compromised. Malnutrition is prevalent in these patients and has been associated with
      increased morbidity and mortality. Standard nutrition therapy, i.e. provision of calories,
      protein and other nutrients consists primarily of enteral nutrition (via a feeding tube into
      the gastrointestinal tract), parenteral nutrition (via an intravenous tube into the blood),
      or occasionally a combination of both.

      However, the provision of nutrition is sub-optimal and the majority of critically-ill
      patients do not meet nutritional requirements. Recent studies report that average energy
      intakes of critically ill patients are only 49% to 70% of calculated requirements. Despite
      repeated, sustained efforts over the past few years, the investigators have not significantly
      improved the amount of calories delivered via the enteral route. This leads us to conclude
      that if the investigators are to be successful at increasing the provision of calories and
      protein to patients at-risk, the investigators will have to supplement the calories via the
      parenteral route.

      Critically ill patients that are at extremes of weight are at a higher nutritional risk and
      have higher mortality rates. A recent International multicenter observational study of 2772
      ICU patients from 165 ICUs showed a significant inverse linear relationship between the odds
      of mortality and total daily calories received. Increased amounts of calories was most
      important for the BMI < 20 group followed by the BMI 20 -< 25 group and BMI > 35 group with
      no benefit of increased calorie intake for patients in the BMI 25 -< 35 group. Feeding an
      additional 1000 kcals almost halved the odds of 60-day mortality in patients with a BMI < 25
      or > 35. Similar results were observed for feeding an additional 30 grams of protein per day.

      Thus, a prospective randomized trial is warranted to confirm our hypothesis that in patients
      with a BMI of < 25 and those with a BMI > 35 increasing the provision of more energy and
      protein can impact clinical outcomes. The results of this study will serve to answer some
      fundamental questions with regards to impact of amount of energy and protein delivered to
      nutritional at-risk ICU patients and will inform current practice.

      Study Intervention:

      Patients will be randomized to one of 2 interventions: enteral nutrition alone or enteral
      nutrition plus parenteral nutrition (supplemental PN group).

        -  Compare the hemoglobin level of these patients during radiotherapy.

        -  Compare the acute and late toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center, site of disease (larynx vs hypopharynx vs
      oropharynx vs oral cavity), T-classification (T1-2 vs T3-4), N-classification and intent of
      systematic neck node dissection (N0-1 vs N2-3 without node dissection vs N2-3 with node
      dissection), hemoglobin level and gender (men with 10-12.5 g/dL vs men with 12.5-14 g/dL vs
      women with 10-12 g/dL vs women with 12-13.5 g/dL), and type of treatment (EORTC standard vs
      other vs randomized in other trials). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard radiotherapy 5 days a week and receive concurrent
           epoetin alfa subcutaneously (SC) once weekly.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I and receive concurrent placebo SC once
           weekly.

      Treatment on both arms continues for 6-8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3-6 weeks and 9-14 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. After any locoregional recurrence, patients are
      followed every 6 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.

      safety of P-3073 in patients affected by isolated psoriatic nail(s) and/or those with
      psoriatic nails and concomitant mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis.

      The evaluation of the primary endpoint will be made using the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index
      (NAPSI).

      The secondary objectives will be:

        -  To assess if the topical treatment with P-3073 is able to improve the quality of life
           and discomfort in patients with psoriatic fingernail.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of topical P-3073 in the treatment of psoriatic
           fingernail.

      The study consists of two arms comparing P-3073 (calcipotriene 0.005%) and vehicle. Eligible
      patients will be randomized to either P-3073 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by their
      target nail NAPSI severity at screening.

      The study population will include at least 470 patients (235 for each group) with nail
      psoriasis (fingernails) of the matrix and/or of the nail bed in at least one fingernail.

      The total duration of the trial for each patient will be approximately 29 weeks (from
      Screening to Follow-up). During the 24 weeks of the treatment period, patients will apply the
      assigned treatment to all affected psoriatic fingernails once daily.

      Purpose

      The role of iron in liver carcinogenesis is supported by human, animal and cellular models
      through direct and indirect mechanisms. The accumulation of iron promotes liver cell
      proliferation and is responsible for direct structural damage or mutations of DNA caused by
      free iron itself or reactive oxygen species generated by its accumulation in the liver.

      The influence of hepatic iron overload (HIO) on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
      well established in patients with genetic hemochromatosis or HCC developed on non-cirrhotic
      liver. However, the influence of HIO on the risk of occurrence of HCC in other chronic liver
      disease (including alcoholic and viral C) has been controversial. Recently, a prospective

      to the aetiology of liver disease (alcohol, n = 162 or hepatitis C virus (HCV)infection, n =
      139) has shown the association between HIO and the occurrence of HCC in patients with
      alcoholic cirrhosis. Thus, the assessment of liver iron in routine clinical practice could
      allow the identification of patients at higher risk of developing HCC and in whom preventive
      measures such as iron depletion by phlebotomy could be undertaken. Based on the model of
      genetic hemochromatosis in which its effectiveness on survival improvement and even
      regression of hepatic injury has been shown, its effectiveness on the prognosis and
      prevention of HCC occurrence in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis must now be studied in
      prospective multicentre randomized trials.

      The main objective of the study is to assess in patients with compensated alcoholic cirrhosis
      and HIO, as assessed by MRI, the effect of phlebotomy in order to lower and maintain serum
      ferritin below 50 µg / l on the risk of HCC occurrence. The effect of bloodletting will be
      jointly evaluated on 1) episodes of hepatic decompensation, 2) non HCC liver-related
      mortality 3) changes in HIO during follow-up.

        -  To determine the relation between MTXPG accumulation in leukemic lymphoblasts and
           antileukemic effects, as measured by the inhibition of de novo purine synthesis, and by
           the decrease in circulating blasts during the 4 days after initiation of single-agent

           accumulation cause a paradoxical decrease in the accumulation of long-chain MTXPG in
           lymphoblasts, (e.g., due to ""feedback inhibition"" of folypolyglutamate synthetase)

        -  To determine if there are significant differences in lymphoblast uptake of MTX and

      Details of Treatment Interventions:

      Treatment will consist of three main phases, Remission Induction (including an Upfront HDMTX
      Window), Consolidation, and Continuation.

      Window Therapy Upfront HDMTX is considered the first part of remission induction treatment.
      HDMTX will be given by vein over 24 hours (one day). MTX 500 mg/m2 for standard risk and 250
      mg/m2 for low-risk cases will be given over 1 hour, followed immediately by maintenance
      infusion (4500 mg/m2 for standard/high-risk or 2250 mg/m2 for low-risk cases) over 23 hours.

      Remission Induction Therapy (6-7 weeks) The remaining induction treatment will begin with
      Prednisone 40 mg/m2/day PO (tid) Days 5-32, Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/week IV days 5, 12, 19, 26,
      Daunorubicin 25 mg/m2/week IV days 5, 12, L-asparaginase 10,000 U/m2/dose IM (thrice weekly)
      days 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 (19, 21, 23), and triple intrathecal treatment, followed by
      Etoposide 300 mg/m2/dose IV over 2 hr days 26, 29, 33, plus Cytarabine 300 mg/m2/dose IV over
      2 hr Days 26, 29, 33.

      Triple intrathecal chemotherapy (MHA) is used for the remaining treatment with dosages based
      on age Frequency and total number of triple intrathecal treatment for Remission Induction are
      based on the patient's risk of CNS relapse.

      Consolidation (2 weeks) Patients receive High dose Methotrexate (HDMTX) 2.5 gm/m2 (low-risk)
      or 5 gm/m2 (standard-or-high-risk) IV over 24 hr days 1 and 8 and 6-Mercaptopurine 25
      mg/m2/day PO days 1 to 14. All patients will receive triple intrathecal therapy weekly for
      two doses on Days 1 and 8.

      Continuation treatment (120 weeks for girls and 146 weeks for boys) Post-remission
      continuation treatment begins 7 days after the second course of HDMTX of the consolidation
      treatment, provided that the ANC ≥300/mm3 and platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L. Continuation
      treatment will be 120 weeks for girls and 146 weeks for boys and differs according to the
      risk classification.

      Reinduction Treatment This phase of treatment will be started at weeks 12 and 28 after bone
      marrow examination confirms complete remission.

      Reinduction treatment will be given twice:

      Weeks 12 to 16 and week 28 to 32 for standard/high risk cases; weeks 12 to 15 and weeks 28-31
      for low-risk cases. Leucovorin rescue (5 mg/m2) will be given at 24 and 30 hours after the
      intrathecal treatment during both remission reinduction treatments. No chemotherapy will be

      -  Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are treated somewhat differently
           depending upon on the relative risk of the leukemia recurring. For this study they are
           classified into ""Standard Risk"", ""High Risk"" and ""Infant/High Risk"".

        -  The treatment for patients in the ""Standard Risk"" and ""High Risk"" groups consists of
           three phases of therapy: induction treatment; prevention of brain and spinal cord
           leukemia (CNS treatment); and intensification/continuation chemotherapy.

        -  The treatment for patients in the ""Infant/High Risk"" group consists of four phases of
           therapy: induction treatment; infant intensification therapy;
           intensification/continuation chemotherapy; and CNS treatment.

        -  The induction treatment consists of a combination of chemotherapy drugs whose purpose is
           to kill all detectable leukemia cells. This process usually requires a least one month
           and includes six anti-leukemia drugs. These drugs are: vincristine, doxorubicin,
           methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, asparaginase and steroids (methylprednisolone or
           prednisone).

        -  After the induction phase, ""Infant/High Risk"" patients will receive a highly intensive
           month of treatment (infant intensification) . Drugs used during this month include
           high-dose methotrexate, asparaginase, 6-mercaptopurine and high dose cytosine
           arabinoside (ARA-C).

        -  CNS treatment begins during induction therapy but is intensified during the second and
           third month after diagnosis. Treatment for all patients will include a series of spinal
           taps with the instillation of anti-leukemia drugs, including cytosine arabinoside and
           methotrexate and with or without hydrocortisone (depending upon randomization).

        -  All high risk patients (those in both ""High Risk"" and ""Infant/High Risk"") as well as
           some standard risk patients will receive radiation treatment to the brain. Radiation
           therapy will either be given in either ""conventional"" treatments (once daily for 10
           days), or ""hyperfractionated"" treatments (twice daily at half doses for 10 days). Total
           dose of radiation is 1800 cGy.

        -  Intensification and continuation therapy, begins 4-5 weeks after diagnosis for ""Standard
           Risk"" and ""High Risk"" groups and 4-5 weeks after infant intensification in ""Infant/High
           Risk"" group. This phase of treatment continues until the completion of two years of
           treatment. Patients in the ""Standard Risk"" group will receive five anti-leukemia drugs
           (vincristine, prednisone, methotrexate, asparaginase, and 6-mercaptopurine). Patients in
           ""High Risk"" and ""Infant/High Risk"" will receive six anti-leukemia drugs (vincristine,
           prednisone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, asparaginase and 6-mercaptopurine).

        -  All patients will be able to participate in a randomization comparing two types of
           asparaginase, E.coli and Erwinia. Patients will be randomized to receive either once
           weekly E.coli or once-weekly Erwinia during the Intensification phase, each given for a
           total of 20 weeks.

        -  Patients in the ""Standard Risk"" group are able to participate in an additional
           randomization. Standard risk patients will be randomized to receive one of two different
           regimens designed to prevent central nervous system leukemia, either 1)radiation therapy
           (given twice daily) with chemotherapy in the spinal fluid every 18 weeks, or 2)
           intensive chemotherapy in the spinal fluid alone without radiation.

        -  Patients in the ""High Risk"" and ""Infant/High Risk"" groups are able to participate in two
           randomizations in addition to the asparaginase randomization. The first will be to
           assess whether the drug dexrazoxane prevents heart damage caused by doxorubicin without
           affecting risk of relapse. Patients will be randomized to receive either doxorubicin
           alone or doxorubicin with dexrazoxane during the induction, CNS and intensification
           phases. The second randomization will compare the relative efficacy and toxicity of
           different cranial radiation schedules. Patients will be randomized to receive radiation
           in either once daily or twice daily fractions.

        -  Blood and bone marrow samples will be collected to learn more about the biology of
           leukemia. These samples will also be used to test minimal residual disease levels to
           learn if these levels help predict risk of relapse.

        -  Quality of life questionnaires will also be performed by the parents of patients, by
           children over eight, and by the child's clinician.

      The orally administered second-generation bis-aryl urea tyrosine kinase inhibitor quizartinib
      is very specific for FLT3, has a high capacity for sustained FLT3-inhibition and an
      acceptable toxicity profile. Furthermore, single agent quizartinib doubled the response rate
      as compared to standard of care in a randomized study in r/r-AML. Combination therapy of
      quizartinib with intensive standard induction chemotherapy has been shown to be safe and
      moreover, single agent quizartinib maintenance therapy is feasible even after allogeneic HCT.

      The efficacy of quizartinib in combination with intensive induction and post-remission
      therapy including allogeneic HCT and single agent quizartinib as maintenance therapy is
      evaluated by this protocol. This approach is compared in a randomized manner to the current

      Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) is one of the most challenging complications in long
      term survivors of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. As the number of allogeneic stem cell
      transplantations rises annually, the incidence of chronic GVHD rates have also increased due
      to a variety of factors including but not limited to increasing use of peripheral blood stem
      cell (PBSC) grafts, increasing age of both donors and recipients, and increased use of
      matched unrelated donors. One study showed much lower than traditional acute GHVD rate and
      chronic GHVD which is similar with historical rates when atorvastatin was administered
      prophylactically to both the donors as well as recipients of matched related allogeneic stem
      cell transplantation, lead to the interest in further examining the role of Atorvastatin in
      relation to the development of GVHD. The investigator hypothesize that the administration of
      atorvastatin in recipients of matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a group
      with known higher incidence of chronic GHVD, would be a safe and effective method to reduce
      the incidence of chronic GVHD. Matched related allogeneic stem cell transplantation
      recipients will not be included in this study due to their significantly lower GVHD rates.
      The definition and monitoring of our primary endpoint of GVHD is well established in clinical
      trials in allogeneic stem cell transplantations and the investiagor will utilize the National
      Institutes of Health (NIH) Staging System for the diagnosis and severity assessment of
      chronic GVHD as well the recommendations from the NIH Consensus Conference for the conduct of
      clinical trials in chronic GVHD.

      Several secondary endpoints will be examined as defined below and include standard
      complementary data in the examination of clinical trials in chronic GVHD again as laid out by
      the NIH Consensus Conference for conduct of clinical trials in chronic GHVD.

    ","4-Week Study of Efficacy, Safety and PK of Albuterol-HFA Versus Proventil-HFA in Pediatric Asthma",Asthma,Asthma,"
      This study consists of two periods:

        1. Run-in Period (7-14 days): During the Run-in Period, subjects will maintain their
           current inhaled short-acting B2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapies. All
           long-acting b-agonists (LABA) will be prohibited and replaced with a short-acting
           B2-agonist (Ventolin-HFA) and an inhaled corticosteroid, for a minimum of 7 days. Such
           LABA replacement therapy is not considered as violation of the asthma stability. The
           current orally inhaled corticosteroids may be maintained at the prescribed dosing
           regimen. All concomitant medications must be compliant or adjusted to the restrictions
           and washout time limits per Appendix II. Subjects will document their daily asthma
           symptom scores, treatment regimens, concomitant medications, PEF records, and adverse
           events if any.

        2. Study Period (4 wk): During the 4-week Study Period, subjects will be randomized into
           one of the following 2 double-blinded treatment groups:

             -  Treatment T (Albuterol-HFA, N=24): 216 mcg albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 180 mcg
                albuterol base), oral inhalation, QID;

             -  Treatment R (Proventil-HFA, N=24): 216 mcg albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 180 mcg
                albuterol base), oral inhalation, QID.

      During the Study Period, subjects will document their daily asthma symptom scores, treatment
      regimens, concomitant medications, PEF records, and adverse events if any. Three Clinical
      Visits are to be conducted, for measurement of treatment efficacy with serial spirometry (at
      Clinical Visit 1 and 3); for monitoring safety and compliance (at Clinical Visit 1, 2 and 3);
      and for evaluating pharmacokinetic profiles in part of the study population (greater than or
      equal to 6 subjects per Arm) using a population PK approach (PPK) with a sparse blood
      sampling regimen (at Clinical Visit 3).

      STUDY POPULATION

      Sufficient enrollment will be planned to obtain 48 subjects as ""Per protocol population"",
      with 24 in Albuterol-HFA (Arm T) and 24 in the Proventil-HFA (Arm R). Qualified subjects
      should be:

        1. Male and female patients aged 4 - 11 years (upon screening), and female patients being
           premenarchal upon Visit-1.

        2. With documented mild-to-moderate asthma for at least 6 months prior to screening;

        3. Being able to reliably perform spirometric FEV1 test;

        4. Consent, under supervision of a parent or a legal guardian, to participate in the study;

        5. Having a baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) that is 50.0%-100.0% of
           predicted values at screening (Screening Baseline FEV1);

        6. Demonstrating a greater than or equal to 12.0% FEV1 reversibility in the Reversibility
           Test, at 30 min after inhaling 180 mcg of Ventolin-HFA;

        7. Satisfying the criterion of asthma stability, defined as no significant changes in
           asthma therapy and no asthma-related hospitalization or emergency visits, over 4 weeks
           prior to the screening;

        8. Satisfying the Run-in Period requirements;

        9. Satisfying all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, as specified in Section 4.2.

      TREATMENT REGIMENS

      Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive one of the 2 double-blinded treatments:
      Albuterol-HFA (Treatment T) or Proventil-HFA (Treatment R).

      CLINICAL VISITS:

      The entire study consists of a Screening Period, a Run-in Period, and a Study Period which
      consists of three (3) Clinical Visits. The three (3) Clinical Visits are scheduled with 14±3
      days intervals, as Visit 1 (Day 0 of treatment), Visit 2 (Day 14), and Visit 3 (Day 28). The
      Clinical Visit 1 will be held within 7-14 days after Screening Visit. Serial FEV1 are
      performed at Visit 1 and 3. Safety and compliance are evaluated at all 3 Visits. Population
      PK (PPK) blood sampling is conducted at Visit 3.

      METHODOLOGIES AND SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS

        1. Forced Expiratory Volume at 1st Second (FEV1)

           Spirometry is to be used to determine Forced Expiratory Volume in the 1st second (FEV1).
           Patient may choose either a standing or a sitting position for FEV1. The position, once
           chosen, should be kept consistent for the entire study. Nose clips will be worn for the
           FEV1 measurements.

           Each FEV1 is measured in triplicate at a given test or a given time point. The highest
           FEV1 volume, from the triplicate attempts, is used as the representative value. The
           highest and second highest FEV1 attempts should not differ by greater than 0.2 L. Up to
           2 additional attempts may be measured if necessary, with a total of 3-5 attempts allowed
           for a given test. The accepted attempts have to be technically conforming to the current
           spirometry standards from the American Thoracic Society (ATS). The current clinical
           normative lung volumes in conformity with the ATS guidelines will be used for
           calculating the predicted percentage.

        2. Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Rate

      PEF will be measured as a means of monitoring safety and asthma control. PEF will be measured
      in triplicate, with additional attempts if necessary. The highest PEF volume is used as the
      representative value. Two measurements of PEF are made daily, once prior to the first AM dose
      and once prior to the last PM dose of the study drug. Subject will be standing for PEF
      measurements. No nose-clips will be needed for PEF.

      2) Screening Baseline FEV1

      Passing the Screening Baseline FEV1 test is one of the prerequisites for enrollment, and is
      to be conducted at the Screening Visit by all subjects. The Screening Baseline FEV1 should
      fall within 50.0%-100.0% of the predicted value to qualify the subject.

      3) Reversibility FEV1 Test

      Reversibility FEV1 Test will be performed at the Screening Visit. Within 30 min after the
      Screening Baseline FEV1 is obtained, the subject will self-administer 180 to 360 mcg
      Ventolin-HFA (2-4 inhalations). To qualify for the study, the subject needs to demonstrate an
      FEV1 reversibility of greater than or equal to 12.0%, from the (same-day) Screening Baseline
      FEV1, with 3 to 8 attempts, at 30 min after inhaling Ventolin-HFA. Reversibility is defined
      as:

      % Reversibility = [(FEV1 postdose ~ FEV1 predose)/FEV1 predose] x 100%

      Up to two-time re-tests of the Reversibility FEV1 Test will be allowed if the highest
      attempted reversibility value is less than 12.0% but greater than or equal to 6.0, if deemed
      necessary by the investigator, with screening period extendable to a total of 21 days.

      4) Serial FEV1 measurements of study drug efficacy

      Response to the study drugs (T and R) is examined by serial spirometric measurements of FEV1
      post-dose. Serial FEV1 will be conducted at each of the following time points during Study
      Visits 1 and 3:

        1. at baseline (within 30 minutes prior to study drug dosing).

        2. at 10, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes after dosing.

      POPULATION PHARMACOKINETIC (PPK) EVALUATION

      At clinical Visit 3, a sufficient number of patients will be subject to a population
      pharmacokinetic (PPK) study to obtain a minimum of 6 subjects per arm with complete and
      correct 4 PK samples. An indwelling IV catheter may be used, as an alternative to repeated
      venipunctures, for PPK samples. An appropriate anticoagulant may be used to maintain the
      catheter patency. Four blood samples (~5.0 mL each) will be taken from a hand or forearm vein
      of the subject, at pre-scheduled 4 time points: 2, 4, 6 and 8 hr post-dose (each with a ±15
      min window). No inhalation of the study drug or rescue medication should take place until
      completion of the 8-hr PK sampling, unless needed for rescue, at which point the subject will
      not be considered evaluable for the PK endpoint.

      Septic shock is common in patients admitted to intensive care and hospital mortality occurs
      in close to 50% of these patients. In half of the cases, death occurs within the first 72
      hours in a context of multiple organ failure that does not respond to conventional therapies,
      particularly circulatory therapies, despite increasing doses of catecholamines. Vasopressor
      resistance in septic patients defines refractory septic shock. In one study (Conrad et al.
      2015), the increase in blood pressure observed with an infusion of increasing doses of
      phenylephrine (dose-response curve) made it possible to quickly and clearly identify patients
      resistant to vasopressors at a high risk of death by refractory shock (ROC AUC 0.92). This
      resistance is due in particular to a downregulation of α1 adrenergic receptors, linked to
      sympathetic hyper activation associated with septic shock. To date, there is no validated
      therapy in this situation. However, experimental data have shown that the administration of
      α2 agonists, usually used for their sedative (dexmedetomidine) or anti-hypertensive
      (clonidine) effect, normalizes sympathetic activity towards basal values. In animals, α2
      agonists restore the sensitivity of alpha1 adrenergic receptors, resulting in improved
      vasopressor sensitivity and survival. In humans, a beneficial effect on mortality was
      suggested in the first trial testing dexmedetomidine in septic patients in 2017. This effect
      was observed especially in the most severe patients, suggesting a restoration of sensitivity
      to vasopressors.

      The hypothesis is that the administration of dexmedetomidine in patients in refractory septic
      shock may improve response to phenylephrine and decrease resistance to vasopressors. This
      pilot study could lay the foundation for a randomized controlled trial.

      The purpose of the study is to see how two classes of blood pressure

      and on the carotid arteries.

      More than 400,000 individuals with chronic kidney disease undergo hemodialysis each year in
      the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality
      in these patients. Conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) do not
      adequately explain this increased mortality, whereas biomarker of oxidative stress and
      inflammation correlate with clinical outcomes. Even with the use of biocompatible membranes,
      hemodialysis induces a systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by complement activation,
      leukocyte activation and the generation of reactive oxygen species and cytokines. Oxidative
      stress and inflammation promote endothelial dysfunction, a predictor of atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular events.

      The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade differ in their long term effects on biomarkers
      of fibrinolysis, oxidative stress,inflammation and on carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), a
      predictor of cardiovascular events, in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing
      maintenance hemodialysis.

      Endogenous Bradykinin (BK) contributes to the hypotensive and pro-fibrinolytic effects of ACE
      inhibitors. It has been determined that endogenous BK contributes to the vasodilator effects
      of acute and chronic ACE inhibition. Studies have found that BK stimulates vascular tissue
      plasminogen activator (t-PA) release through a BK B2 receptor-dependent, nitric oxide (NO)
      and cyclooxygenase-independent pathway. Hemodialysis patients demonstrates endothelial
      dysfunction. Data suggests that t-PA release may be attenuated during stimulation of the
      endogenous kallikrein-kinin system by hemodialysis.

      Intra-arterial infusion of BK increases vascular release of F2- isoprostanes, markers of
      oxidative stress, BK infusions also increase net release of the inflammatory cytokine
      interleukin-6 (IL-6). Preliminary data raise the possibility that activation of the
      endogenous kallikrein-kinin system during dialysis could promote inflammation in individuals
      with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an ACE inhibitor.

      Cardiopulmonary bypass activates the endogenous kallikrein-kinin system and causes a systemic
      inflammatory response. Like hemodialysis, cardiopulmonary bypass activates the endogenous
      kallikrein-kinin system, increasing BK concentrations. In smokers, who like hemodialysis
      patients exhibit endothelial dysfunction, the t-PA response to BK was attenuated during
      cardiopulmonary bypass.

      ACE inhibition enhances fibrinolysis and decreases inflammation following cardiopulmonary
      bypass. The short-term effect of both ACE inhibition and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1)
      receptors on markers of fibrinolysis and inflammation during dialysis are currently being
      studied.

      Circulating BK concentrations are increased during hemodialysis in individuals treated with
      an ACE inhibitors compared to those treated with an AT1 receptor blocker.

      Bradykinin receptor blockade and the fibrinolytic and inflammatory response to hemodialysis.
      It is hypothesized that subjects with CAD, the t-PA response to hemodialysis will be blunted
      compared to that measured in subjects without evidence of CAD, whereas the inflammatory
      response wil be similar or enhanced.

      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor
      patient knows the name of the assigned study drugs), double-dummy (all patients are given
      both a placebo [salt solution] and study drug in alternating periods of time during the
      study), active comparator-controlled (compare the ""test"" treatment to standard-of-care
      therapy), multinational, multicenter study to evaluate the safety of the study drugs
      (doripenem and meropenem) administered by intravenous (iv) infusion (slow injection of drug
      solution into the vein over a period of time) in children aged 3 months to less than 18 years

      the small intestine), or gall bladder perforation (a hole in the wall of the stomach, small
      intestine, or gallbladder), and secondary peritonitis. The study will include 3 periods: a
      pretreatment (screening) period that will occur within 2 days prior to randomization
      (assignment of study drug), a treatment period of 5 to 14 days where patients will receive iv
      study drug treatment only or IV study therapy and a switch to oral antibiotic therapy, and a

      events, changes in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, and findings from
      physical examinations observed during treatment and at each posttreatment visit. An

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CG5503 (tapentadol) is effective and safe
      in the treatment of chronic tumor related pain compared to placebo.
    ",A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of CG5503 (Tapentadol) in the Treatment of Chronic Tumor Related Pain Compared With Placebo and Morphine,"['Pain', 'Neoplasm', 'Cancer']",Cancer Pain,"
      Normally chronic tumor related pain is controlled when subjects receive repeated doses of
      opioid analgesics. However, opioid therapy is commonly associated with side effects such as
      nausea, vomiting, sedation, constipation, addiction, tolerance, and respiratory depression.
      Tapentadol, a newly synthesized drug with an Prolonged Release (ER) formulation, also acts as
      a centrally acting pain reliever but has a dual mode of action.

      The aim of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness (level of pain control) and safety
      (side effects) of Tapentadol Prolonged Release (ER) compared to a tablet with no active
      ingredient drug (placebo) and a corresponding dose of Morphine (an opioid commonly used to
      treat tumor related pain). This trial is a randomized, double-blind (neither investigator nor
      patient will know which treatment was received), active- and placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, randomized-withdrawal, multicenter trial. To maintain the blind all subjects
      were re-randomized at the start of the maintenance period. To maintain the blind all
      tapentadol subjects were re-randomized at the start of the maintenance period. Subjects that
      received morphine in the titration period continued in the maintenance period on morphine.

      The trial includes a 2 week titration phase starting with either 45 mg Morphine Sulfate
      Controlled Release (CR) twice daily or 100 mg tapentadol ER taken twice daily (bid). Based on
      effectiveness and side effects participants can up-titrate in steps of 50 mg Tapentadol ER or
      15 mg Morphine Sulfate CR to a maximal dose of 250 mg Tapentadol ER bid or 90 mg Morphine
      Sulfate CR twice daily respectively. If subjects meet the stabilization criteria at the end
      of the titration phase they will be re-randomized to either placebo or active treatment and
      will continue 4 weeks at the last dose level in the maintenance phase.

      Assessments of pain relief, defined as a responder include the pain intensity numeric rating
      scale (NRS). The Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC) will also be used as a
      secondary efficacy endpoint. Safety evaluations include monitoring of adverse events,
      physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. Venous blood samples will be collected
      for the determination of serum concentrations of tapentadol.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. It
      is not yet known if combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without peripheral
      stem cell transplantation in treating Hodgkin's Disease.

           without autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and high-dose
           chemotherapy.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these treatment regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to number
      of poor prognostic factors (3 vs 4 vs 5) and stage of disease (III vs IV).

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes,
      bleomycin IV over 10 minutes, vinblastine IV over 5 minutes, and dacarbazine IV over 15-30
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 5 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who show at least partial response
      after the fifth course of induction chemotherapy and whose blood counts have recovered are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive 3 additional courses of induction chemotherapy for a total of 8
           courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive 1 additional course of induction chemotherapy followed by stem
           cell collection. Patients then receive high-dose chemotherapy with carmustine IV over 2
           hours on days -6 to -4, etoposide IV over 4 hours on day -4, and cyclophosphamide IV on
           day -2. Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      Patients are followed at 60 days, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      Despite improved glycemic and systemic control for many patients with diabetes, over the past
      several decades, diabetic retinopathy (DR) develops and progresses in a large proportion of
      patients, and visual loss from diabetic eye complications continues to be a leading cause of
      blindness in the US and other developed countries worldwide. Thus, even a modest ability to
      prevent DR onset or to slow DR worsening might substantially reduce the number of patients at
      risk for diabetes-related vision loss worldwide. Widespread use of an oral agent effective at
      reducing worsening of DR might also decrease the numbers of patients who undergo treatment
      for DR and diabetic macular edema (DME) and who are consequently at risk for side effects
      that adversely affect visual function. Two major studies of fenofibrate, the Fenofibrate
      Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) and The Action to Control Cardiovascular
      Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD)-eye study, have demonstrated clinically important reduction in
      progression of retinopathy in patients with diabetes assigned to fibrate compared with
      placebo. However, despite the positive clinical trial results, fenofibrate has not gained
      wide acceptance as a preventive agent by either ophthalmologists or primary diabetes care
      providers. Thus, it is important to provide further evidence demonstrating whether or not
      selectively increasing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) activity
      reduces progression of retinopathy in patients with diabetes and non-proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy at baseline. Pemafibrate is a more potent and selective PPARα modulator than
      fenofibrate. Its efficacy is currently being evaluated in the Pemafibrate to Reduce
      Cardiovascular OutcoMes by Reducing Triglycerides IN patiENts With diabeTes (PROMINENT) study
      for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. Given the large
      study cohort with a substantial proportion likely to have DR and the multi-year duration of
      the PROMINENT trial, this study represents a unique opportunity to assess effects of chronic
      PPARα activation through pemafibrate therapy on DR outcomes.

      Primary Study Objective: To assess whether treatment with pemafibrate (0.2 mg orally BID)
      compared with placebo reduces the hazard rate of diabetic retinopathy worsening in adults
      with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy without neovascularization in at least one eye
      who are participating in the parent PROMINENT trial.

      Constraint-Induced Movement therapy or CI therapy is a rehabilitation method, that has been
      shown in controlled studies to produce improvements of upper limb motor function in stroke
      patients. However, in the original method, 6 hours of daily training are requested, which is
      often impossible to apply in the majority of rehabilitation unit.

      On January 9, 2020, a new emerging virus was identified by WHO as being responsible for
      grouped cases of pneumonia in China. It is a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the
      disease COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease). The disease is mild in 85% of cases but the
      proportion of serious cases requiring hospitalization or intensive care (15%) puts stress on
      health structures and systems around the world.

      To limit the influx of patients and avoid overstretching Health systems, containment and
      social distancing strategies are widely adopted.

      It appears crucial to propose the easiest possible therapeutic strategy taking into account
      the ambulatory nature of the patients. Therefore azithromycin (AZM) is an antibiotic known to
      have an antiviral effect but also which has anti-inflammatory activity in addition to its
      antimicrobial effect. Azithromycin targets preferentially pulmonary cells (and particularly
      of the lines apparently affected in COVID-19 positive cases). The aim of this study is to
      demonstrate that AZM decreases symptom duration in COVID19 patients and diminishes the viral
      carriage.
    ",Proactive Care of Ambulatory COVID19 Patients,"['Covid19', 'Azithromycin', 'Ambulatory']",COVID-19,"
      On January 9, 2020, a new emerging virus was identified by WHO as being responsible for
      grouped cases of pneumonia in China. It is a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the
      disease COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease). The disease is mild in 85% of cases but the
      proportion of serious cases requiring hospitalization or intensive care (15%) puts stress on
      health structures and systems around the world.

      To limit the influx of patients and avoid overstretching Health systems, containment and
      social distancing strategies are widely adopted.

      It appears crucial to propose the easiest possible therapeutic strategy taking into account
      the ambulatory nature of the patients. Treatment must be as safe as possible allowing a wide
      distribution to the symptomatic population while keeping a favorable risk/benefice balance
      for a patient with little symptoms.

      Several studies show that azithromycin (AZM) has an anti-inflammatory effect. In patients
      with cystic fibrosis, AZM is known to have an anti-fibrotic effect by targeting myofibroblast
      cells, which considerably prolongs their lifespan. AZM acts functionally as an
      anti-inflammatory drug and reduces senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
      mediators, such as IL-1beta and IL-632. AZM has also been shown to inhibit the replication of
      certain viruses, such as Zika and Ebola.

      Therefore AZM is an antibiotic known to have an antiviral effect but also which has
      anti-inflammatory activity in addition to its antimicrobial effect. Azithromycin targets
      preferentially pulmonary cells (and particularly of the lines apparently affected in COVID-19
      positive cases) Therefore, the prescription of AZM in COVID-19 + patients aims to increase
      the antiviral response locally at pulmonary level, while promoting a decrease in the immune
      response at systemic level.

      Its specific effect and excellent clinical tolerance justifies its use as monotherapy in
      non-severe covid-19 + cases for the present study.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that AZM decreases symptom duration in COVID19
      patients and diminishes the viral carriage.

      It is estimated that up to 20% of patients who have Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) surgery
      will not meet their weight loss goal, or may even regain some of the weight they initially
      lost. One possible explanation is that the opening between the stomach pouch and the
      intestine becomes stretched. If this opening becomes too wide, food may be able to pass from
      the stomach to the intestine too quickly - causing patients to feel less full after eating.

      For some patients, doctors may recommend additional invasive surgery to tighten the opening
      between the stomach pouch and the small intestine. Although this may help patients resume
      their weight loss, the risk of complications during a second surgical procedure is
      significantly higher than the risk during the original gastric bypass.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an incisionless procedure for patients who have
      either had inadequate weight loss or have regained weight following gastric bypass. The
      procedure is designed to tighten the opening between the stomach pouch and the small
      intestine, which may slow down the passage of food to help patients feel full longer after
      eating.

      Standard investigations fail to reveal any apparent cause in 50% of the cases of recurrent
      spontaneous abortion. Prothrombotic mechanisms were initially evoked. Factor V Leiden,
      Prothrombin G20210A mutation and protein S deficiency are implicated in the meta-analysis of
      Rey (Lancet).However, they do not account for a large number of miscarriages.Gris JC and
      coworkers (Blood 2004)carried out an open trial, low-molecular-weight heparin versus low-dose
      aspirin, in women with one fetal loss and with a constitutional thrombophilic disorder. They
      conclude for a benefit action of Low-molecular-weight heparin. There is actually no trials
      concerning women with unexplained recurrent abortions and without known thrombophilia.
      Nevertheless,aspirin or enoxaparin are often prescribed. It is time to assess these
      practices. We therefore initiate a multisite, double blind randomized study, enoxaparine
      versus placebo, in women without known thrombophilia, which experienced unexplained recurrent
      abortions.

        2. A 20g IV will be placed in an antecubital vein

        3. Low MI scan will be used in the vascular phase.

        4. An intermediate MI scan will be used after at least a 10 minute delay to perform the
           Kupffer scan

           exam the patient will have a complete evaluation of the vascular phase a second
           injection may be used.

      Each lesion noted within the liver will be measured in two dimensions and recorded. The
      lesion will be classified on a scale of 1 - 5 regarding the probability of benignity or
      malignancy of the lesion. If a diagnosis can be made the diagnosis will be documented. The
      location of the lesion will be documented on a Couinaud Diagram.

        1. characteristic enhancement pattern (hemangioma, benign)

        2. lesion biopsy

        3. growth of the lesion over a 6 month period of time (malignant)

      Data Analysis

      For assessment of characterization efficacy the McNemar test will be used to compare the
      rates of correct diagnosis for lesions on unenhanced ultrasound, CEUS and unenhanced CT or
      MRI. For assessment of detection efficacy, Wilcoxon's signed rank test will be used to
      compare the lesion detection rates obtained with unenhanced ultrasound, CEUS, and unenhanced
      CT or MRI. For all tests, p<0.05 will be considered a statistically significant difference.

      Organ shortage for transplant has necessitated use of kidneys from older donors, increasing
      the chance that the kidney will not work immediately or for as long as expected. The
      investigators gave the drug heme arginate (HA) to 20 kidney transplant patients in the first
      24 hours after transplant, and showed that it may reduce kidney injury and is safe. The
      investigators plan to conduct a large study recruiting 600 patients to determine whether HA
      treatment increases the number of kidney transplants that work immediately. If successful, HA
      may be introduced into clinical practice at the end of this study.

      Patients will be invited to take part in the study once listed for a kidney transplant.
      Further discussions will be had with them when admitted for transplant, and they will be
      offered the opportunity to participate. Consent will not be taken until the patient is
      admitted for transplantation. Following consent, participants will be randomised to receive
      either 2 doses of the study drug, HA, or a salt water solution, one at the time of
      transplant, and one approximately 24 hours later. Otherwise, treatment will be the same as
      any other patient undergoing a kidney transplant. Information about recovery from surgery,
      and specifically about kidney function, will be collected, but will not require additional
      blood tests. The study period ends after the first 7 days post-transplant, although longer
      term data will be collected from routine follow up appointments. Participants will be asked
      to complete a simple quality of life questionnaire 3 times: just before transplant, at
      approximately one week and three months after transplant.

      This study was designed to evaluate the effect of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS) in the resolution of Chronic Pain. Participants will be Veterans from the
      first Gulf War (GW1) who often suffer from chronic pain problems.
    ",rTMS for the Treatment of Chronic Pain in GW1 Veterans,Chronic Pain,Chronic Pain,"
      A number of studies have been conducted on the health of Veterans deployed to Iraq during
      GW1. The focus of these studies has been primarily to define the nature of symptoms and
      symptom clusters and to determine if evidence supports the definition of a new unique
      illness. Most noteworthy is the ""Iowa Study"", a cross-sectional study of 3,695 Veterans from
      Iowa consisting of those who were and were not deployed in GW1. In telephone interviews the
      Gulf War deployed Veterans reported approximately twice the number of symptoms compared to
      those who were not deployed.

      The often ambiguous and seemingly treatment resistant symptoms presented by GW1 Veterans
      represent a challenge to the Veteran's Affairs Health Care System on two fronts; efficacy in
      treatment and cost. In particular, unlike most medical conditions which can be diagnosed by
      objective medical findings, pain is a subjective experience (International Association for
      the Study of Pain, 1994). Therefore the investigators propose to engage in a clinical trial
      of rTMS in chronic pain that occurs in the context of multiple medical symptoms in the GW1
      population. The symptom category approach will be applied with the restriction that enrolled
      GWI diagnosed patients will have symptoms of chronic pain as outlined in the musculoskeletal
      category and at least two additional symptoms.

      The overall objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of NRT (Nicoderm patches)
      plus counselling treatment in women in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.
    ",Study of Nicotine Replacement Therapy in Pregnancy,Smoking Cessation,,"
      Smoking during pregnancy is a major public health issue, causing miscarriages, prematurity,
      intrauterine growth retardation, stillbirth, and the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). It
      is estimated that 25-40% of pregnant smokers try to stop smoking on their own upon learning
      that they are pregnant. While pregnancy is often a strong motivator for smoking cessation,
      many nicotine-dependent women cannot quit smoking. The most important factor underlying the
      inability to quit smoking is strong dependence on a certain level nicotine, which is unique
      in every individual.

      Several publications have shown that the use of the nicotine patch during the second and
      third trimesters is not associated with maternal or fetal compromise. More importantly,
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) during pregnancy exposes the fetus to lower levels of
      nicotine than smoking cigarettes does and, moreover, eliminates exposure to numerous other
      toxic substances.

      Presently, counselling is the standard mode of treatment for the pregnant patients willing to
      quit smoking. Since pharmacologic smoking cessation therapies have been shown to increase
      significantly up to doubling a successful quitting rate when used in adjunction to brief
      physician counselling, the use of an appropriate dose of such agents is essential.

      Induction of labor is a frequently planned obstetric procedure. Induction for women with an
      unfavorable cervix (bishop score <6) increases the risk of cesarean section. This risk may be
      reduced by ripening or softening the cervix before the induction of labor. This protocol
      outlines a randomized trial of 200 women evaluating the placement and use of Cervidil to the
      post vaginal fornix to soften the cervix in preparation for induction.

      This trial is looking at inpatient vs outpatient pre-induction cervical ripening using
      Cervidil and the effects on (1) maternal and newborn outcomes including time of admission to
      delivery, (2) system healthcare cost, (3) cost to patient, and (4) patient satisfaction.

      The investigators hypothesize when compared to patients admitted to the hospital for cervical
      ripening:

        1. From the time of admission, patients in the outpatient cervical ripening arm will
           progress to complete cervical dilation in less time.

           outpatient cervical ripening arm.

      The main object of this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III
      trial is to assess impact of maintenance of orteronel on disease progression and hence on
      quality of life of patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer pretreated
      with novel hormonal agents who have non-progressive disease after chemotherapy with a taxane.
    ",Orteronel Maintenance Therapy in Patients With mCRPC Previously Treated With Novel Hormonal Agents,Prostate Cancer,Prostatic Neoplasms,"
      Background

      One in six men will be diagnosed with cancer of the prostate during his lifetime.
      Accordingly, prostate cancer is the most common cancer amongst men in the western world. In
      Switzerland approx. 5'400 men are diagnosed with the disease and 1'300 die of prostate cancer
      every year. Prostate cancer represents 30% of all cancer diagnoses in men. Despite earlier
      detection and new treatments the life time risk to die of prostate cancer has remained stable
      at 3% since 1980.

      In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (with progression on antihormonal therapy)
      the primary standard therapy for a long time consisted of chemotherapy with docetaxel. It was
      recently shown that treatment with the novel androgen synthesis blocker, abiraterone (Zytiga)
      before chemotherapy can prolong survival. Abiraterone belongs to a group of agents that very
      effectively inhibits the androgen synthesis via blockade of the key enzyme cytochrome
      P-450c17 (CYP17).Similar results have been reported for the new androgen antagonist
      enzalutamide (Xtandi). Today, therefore, many patients with metastatic castration-resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) first receive therapy with abiraterone or enzalutamide. After this,
      chemotherapy with docetaxel (Taxotere) or cabazitaxel (Jevtana) is usually administered if
      there is any further progression of the disease. After the end of chemotherapy, the patient
      is regularly checked and, in the event of disease progression, further treatments may be
      given. These could consist of renewed hormonal therapy or chemotherapy with cabazitaxel.
      Besides abiraterone, the medicine orteronel also acts by blocking testosterone production via
      the key enzyme CYP17. By selectively inhibiting the extragonadal synthesis of androgens in
      either the adrenal cortex or in prostate tumor cells, orteronel, a selective non-steroidal
      CYP17 inhibitor, may represent a new therapeutic option for patients with CRPC. Initial
      results have shown that orteronel effectively inhibits testosterone synthesis.

      Hypothesis and aim of the study

      Since various new options are available for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer
      at present, this raises the question as to the order in which these treatments should best be
      given. Initial results show that cross-resistance could develop between the new kinds of
      hormone therapy abiraterone and enzalutamide. There is evidence to suggest that any
      resistance to hormone treatments could be reversible as a result of prior treatment with
      chemotherapy. This study is designed to investigate this approach. It is also intended to
      investigate whether early use of the well-tolerated testosterone synthesis blocker orteronel
      in patients with mCRPC leads to an increase in the time to the progression of disease. Trials
      examining other advanced malignant diseases such as lung cancer have shown that initiating an
      effective treatment earlier in the disease course at the end of a first-line chemotherapy (so
      called switch maintenance therapy) is beneficial in terms of progression free survival (PFS)
      but also overall survival (OS). This may also hold true for early administration of
      antihormonal agents in patients with mCRPC.

      Patients who have already received a novel hormonal therapy followed by chemotherapy with a
      taxane and have experienced a stabilization of disease on this regimen are included in the
      study. It is also intended to test whether this treatment has a positive influence on the
      quality of life of patients.

      The aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that using orteronel treatment immediately
      after cessation of chemotherapy with a taxane can prolong event-free survival (EFS),
      consequently maintains a good quality of life (QL) and could eventually also improve overall
      survival for the group of patients pretreated with novel hormonal agents.

      I. To demonstrate that patient-reported Patient-Report Outcomes Version of the Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) data will be able to detect differences
      in symptoms between participants treated witheribulin mesylate (eribulin) and standard weekly
      paclitaxel at 12 weeks.

      II. To validate rs7349683 in EPHA5 as a predictor of peripheral neuropathy from treatment
      with a microtubule targeting agent (i.e., eribulin or paclitaxel).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival, progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate
      (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and time to treatment failure (TTF) in patients receiving
      eribulin versus standard weekly paclitaxel.

      II. To compare the 12 month rate of disease progression in patients receiving eribulin versus
      standard weekly paclitaxel.

      III. To evaluate the clinical value and feasibility of collecting patient-reported symptom
      toxicity information via the Patient-Report Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).

      IV. To further validate the PRO-CTCAE sensory neuropathy items. V. To compare patient
      reported neurotoxicity between arms using the European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral
      Neuropathy 20 (CIPN20) instrument.

      VI. To assess the toxicities in patients receiving eribulin versus standard weekly
      paclitaxel.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare new metastasis free survival in patients receiving eribulin versus standard
      weekly paclitaxel.

      II. To explore the relationship between common single nucleotide polymorphisms in FGD4, FZD3,
      and VAC14 as predictors of peripheral neuropathy from treatment with a microtubule targeting
      agent (i.e., eribulin or paclitaxel).

      III. To evaluate circulating nucleosomes and the apoptosis associated M30 neo-epitope as
      potential biomarkers associated with clinical benefit from treatment with eribulin
      specifically or the microtubule dynamics inhibitors in general.

      VI. To evaluate tubulin isotype expression, mutations, and signaling pathway modifications in
      tumor tissue as potential biomarkers associated with clinical benefit from treatment with
      eribulin specifically or the microtubule dynamics inhibitors in general.

      Losmapimod is a new anti-inflammatory medication which potentially may benefit patients with
      Acute Coronary Syndrome, (ACS), a condition which includes heart attack. There is a growing
      understanding that the inflammatory response to ACS is integral to the subsequent evolution
      of plaque instability. Losmapimod inhibits p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), an
      enzyme which may play a central role in inflammation in the setting of heart attack.
      Inhibition of p38 MAPK may stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce the risk of subsequent
      plaque rupture, indirectly improve vascular function and prevent subsequent thrombosis, and
      thus reduce infarct size and the risk of subsequent cardiac events. This study will test
      whether losmapimod can safely reduce the risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event (such as
      death, heart attack, or near heart attack requiring urgent treatment ) when started
      immediately after ACS (specifically, heart attack). Patients who present with heart attack
      and qualify for the study will be randomly assigned to receive 3 months treatment with either
      losmapimod twice daily or placebo, which will be administered in addition to the usual
      standard of care therapies for heart attack. Following the in-hospital period, subjects will
      return for outpatient visits at 4 and 12 weeks, as well as a follow up visit at 24 weeks.

      Trigeminal neuralgia or tic douloureux is severe, often debilitating, facial pain that
      significantly impairs the patient's quality of life and health. Stereotactic radiosurgery has
      been shown to provide pain relief in majority of patients treated. However, a common side
      effect of radiosurgery is facial numbness. Our goal is to maximize pain control while
      minimizing side effects. To this end, the purpose of this study is to evaluate whether adding
      a drug, amifostine, at the time of radiosurgery will protect patients from facial numbness.

      This phase III trial compares the usual chemotherapy treatment to eribulin alone and to
      eribulin plus gemcitabine in treating patients with urothelial cancer that has spread to
      other places in the body (metastatic). Chemotherapy drugs, such as eribulin, gemcitabine,
      docetaxel, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      This trial aims to see whether adding eribulin to standard of care chemotherapy may work
      better in treating patients with metastatic urothelial cancer.

        -  To assess biomarkers of response to standard and investigational treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of
      carcinoma in situ (yes vs no), prior bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy (induction vs
      maintenance), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (experimental): Patients receive intravesical mitomycin C over two 30-minute
           instillations per session, and bladder hyperthermia (42 +/-2°C) is delivered in
           combination with each instillation. The suspension is maintained in the bladder for up
           to 2 hours. Treatment repeats once a week for 6 weeks followed by a 6-week rest period.
           Patients who are disease-free proceed to maintenance therapy consisting of one
           instillation of mitomycin C with bladder hyperthermia every 6 weeks for 1 year and then
           once every 8 weeks for 1 year. Patients who are disease-free at 24 months may continue
           treatment at the discretion of the clinician.

        -  Arm II (control): Patients receive 1 of the following treatment regimens depending on
           prior BCG treatment.

             -  Second course of BCG therapy (patients who failed previous induction BCG): Patients
                receive intravesical BCG (1 instillation) once a week for 6 weeks. The suspension
                is maintained in the bladder for up to 2 hours. Patients then receive maintenance
                therapy consisting of BCG once a week for 3 weeks in months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24.
                Patients who are disease-free at 24 months may continue treatment at the discretion
                of the clinician.

             -  Standard therapy (patients who failed previous maintenance BCG): Patients receive
                standard therapy for BCG failure as defined by their treating centers. Standard

      Drug-resistance is a major challenge for tuberculosis (TB) care programs. The new WHO
      guideline recommends adding levofloxacin in previously treated patients with
      isoniazid-resistant rifampicin-susceptible TB. The investigators believe that such a
      retreatment regimen may result in acquired resistance to fluoroquinolone, the core drug of
      multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) regimen, and thus threaten the effectiveness of the
      fluoroquinolone-based MDR-TB treatment regimen. Therefore the investigators propose to study
      if regimens strengthened by using high-dose first-line drugs, either a triple dose of
      isoniazid or a triple dose of rifampicin, are non-inferior to the WHO recommended
      levofloxacin-strengthened regimen. If one of both high-dose regimens would be non-inferior,
      it could replace the levofloxacin-strengthened regimen.

      tendinopathy), and foot/lower leg symptoms.

      Corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid infiltrations were not allowed 3 and 6 months prior to
      entry, respectively. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesics or slow action
      drugs (DMARDs) were allowed if prescribed at least four weeks and eight weeks before entry
      and remained unchanged throughout the study.

      The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee and all patients signed informed
      consent.

      Study protocol:

      Patients will be randomly assigned into 2 groups: CASES with 16 patients and CONTROLS with
      fourteen patients. The CASES wore 8 mm high, medial-wedged insoles for the hind foot inserted
      into a new shoe for 8 weeks. The CONTROLS will use an insole resembling the former group,
      only without raised wedges (FIGURE 1-B) for 8 weeks. Patients of both groups will receive the
      same new shoe and were blind to the insole use.

      The ethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA - density 50) insoles were provided by the AACD Institute
      (Handicapped Child Care Association). A commercial neoprene with elastic banding will be used
      for ankle support. Both groups will use similar standard shoes supplied by the hospital. Each
      participant will be instructed to use the splints (shoes and elastic banding) for 3 to 6
      hours daily. The correct use of the splints will be checked every two weeks. Undesirable
      side-effects will be recorded at the end of the study.

      Age, disease duration, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and sedentarism (only daily
      activities) will be recorded for all patients at entry. In order to assess symptoms, Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS) will be used for night pain, pain at rest and on movement. Lequesne index
      score and the WOMAC questionnaire will be applied at baseline and after 8 weeks by a blinded
      examiner.

      Antero-posterior conventional X-ray of knees and ankles will be performed under monopodalic
      load with and without insoles in order to measure femorotibial, talocalcaneal, and talus tilt
      angles. Femorotibial angle is formed by the intersection of femur and tibia axes, obtained
      through lines drawn at distal one-third of the femur and proximal one-third of the tibia,
      both equidistant from external limits of the cortical bones. Talocalcaneal angle is formed by
      a first line connecting the midpoints between the trochanter talus to the lateral and medial
      malleoli, and a second line perpendicular to the floor identified by inferior border of
      X-ray. Tilt angle of talus is formed by a line parallel to floor and the tilt of the
      trochanter talus. All angles will be measured blind by the same rheumatologist.

      In addition to other Screening assessments, participants underwent an assessment of
      urothelial carcinoma of the bladder via cystoscopy for clinically apparent tumor of Ta
      histology, including PUNLMP, although participants with strongly suspected PUNLMP at
      Screening or transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) were not to be enrolled in the
      study. The qualifying cystoscopy could be performed up to 45 days prior to signing the
      informed consent.

      Eligible participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either:

        -  Arm 1: One dose of 8 milligrams (mg) Qapzola

        -  Arm 2: One dose of placebo

      Once approved for randomization, participants underwent TURBT on Day 1 and the study drug
      instillation occurred at 60 ± 30 minutes post-TURBT and was retained for 60 minutes (±5
      minutes) in the bladder. All histology specimens were reviewed by a local pathology
      laboratory and all clinical treatment decisions were based on the local pathology review.
      Participant target disease was confirmed and efficacy analyses were performed based on the
      pathology results. The target study population was low- to intermediate-risk participants who
      had Ta histology, including PUNLMP, as confirmed by a pathology laboratory. Participants with
      strongly suspected PUNLMP at Screening or TURBT were not to be enrolled in the study.
      Participants whose tumor histology did not meet the criteria for eligibility, as confirmed by
      pathology (Non-Target Population), were to be followed up for safety on Day 35 (±5 days)
      (Safety Follow-up Visit) and were discontinued from the study. If the pathology results were
      delayed beyond 35 days, the Safety Follow-up Visit was to be conducted when the results were
      available for these participants.

      Participants who had pathology-confirmed target histology did not receive additional
      medications to treat NMIBC during the follow-up while on the study. All target disease
      participants were to be followed until either a confirmed tumor recurrence, additional
      bladder cancer treatments, or until the End-of-Study, whichever occurred first.

      The primary analysis was conducted once the required number of recurrence events were
      observed. A recurrence was defined as any pathologically confirmed disease of ≥Ta histology
      or carcinoma in situ (CIS) post-treatment. The number of events needed to perform the final
      primary endpoint analysis was estimated based on the recurrence rate at 24 months from
      previous studies. The follow-up schedule is below:

        -  Cystoscopic examination (all participants) and urine cytology (only participants with a
           Baseline diagnosis of intermediate-risk NMIBC) every 3 months (±30 days) (calculated
           from date of TURBT) for 2 years for tumor recurrence and progression and then every 6
           months (±60 days) until either a confirmed tumor recurrence or the End-of-Study,
           whichever occurred first.

        -  If at any time during the study there was a histologically confirmed tumor recurrence,
           the participants discontinued from the study at that time and could then be treated per
           the Investigator's standard of care.

      The study was to end (End-of-Study) when the required number of events for the primary
      endpoint analysis was accrued.

      Duration of Study: The duration of the study for each participant was as follows:

        -  Screening Period: up to 30 days

        -  Treatment: Day 1

        -  Safety Follow-up: Day 35 (±5 days) after treatment

        -  Follow-up Period: No follow-up in non-Target Population. Until either a confirmed tumor
           recurrence or the End-of-Study, whichever occurred first in the Target Population.

      During transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation in spinal cord injured men an increase in

      sphincter. A pilot study have since shown that after 6 weeks of stimulation 24 out of 33
      women suffering from urinary stress incontinence were able to contract their pelvic floor
      muscles and had become free of symptoms. Another pilot study has shown promising effect on

      will be randomized to vibration treatment or no vibration treatment. All patients will
      receive pelvic floor training and all women suffering from urge incontinence will receive
      anticholinergic medications.

      The present study evaluates the effect of oral contraceptives on lamotrigine plasma
      concentrations in a double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study in patients with
      epilepsy.
    ",Lamotrigine and Oral Contraceptives,Epilepsy,Epilepsy,"
      Lamotrigine is widely used as an antiepileptic drug in the treatment of newly onset as well
      as refractory epilepsy (1;2). Lamotrigine is unique among the antiepileptic drug since the
      major route (76%) of elimination is conjugation with glucuronic acid (glucuronidation) (3).
      This conjugation reaction is catalyzed by the uridine 5'-diphosphate
      (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs); of which the isoform UGT1A4 probably is the major
      route of metabolism in humans (3). The pathway is inhibited by valproate and induced by other
      anticonvulsants (3), and explains the effect of these drugs on lamotrgine metabolism (4).
      Other drugs that are metabolized via direct glucoronidation may interfere with the metabolism
      of lamotrigine e.g. acetaminophen (5). Estrogeneous substrates are metabolized via
      glucuronidation (6-8) and may potentially interact with the metabolism of lamotrigine. In the
      development of lamotrigine for use in epilepsy patients the effect on the oral contraceptive
      pill was studied. In contrast to other commonly used antiepileptic drugs e.g. carbamazepine
      and phenytoin(9), lamotrigine did not significantly influence the constituents of the oral
      contraceptive pill (10-12). In addition, it was initially assumed from population
      pharmacokinetic studies, that oral contraceptives did not influence the metabolism of
      lamotrigine (13).However, recent retrospective studies indicate that oral contraceptives may
      increase the metabolism of lamotrigine resulting in a significant decrease in plasma
      concentration of lamotrigine when given with oral contraceptives (14;15). This effect is
      probably related to the ethinyl estradiol content of the combined contracetive pill and no
      the progesterone content (16).

      To confirm and further extend these findings, the present study evaluates the effect of oral
      contraceptives on lamotrigine plasma concentrations in a double blind, placebo controlled,
      cross-over study in patients with epilepsy.

      Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) involves extensive
      inflammation in the lungs that can lead to rapid respiratory failure. These conditions are
      most commonly caused by pneumonia, generalized infection, or severe trauma to the lungs, but
      can also be less commonly caused by smoke or salt water inhalation, drug overdose, or shock.

      For some people, ALI/ARDS resolves without treatment, but many severe cases result in
      hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU), where 30% to 40% of cases end in mortality.
      Current treatments for ALI/ARDS include assisted breathing with a ventilator, supportive
      care, and management of the underlying causes.

      Upon admission to the ICU, Rosuvastatin or placebo was administered through an enteral
      feeding tube or administered orally following extubation when patients were able to safely
      take oral medications. The type and placement of the enteral feeding tube (nasogastric,
      nasoenteric, PEG, orogastric, oroenteric, etc.) and the ability to safely take oral
      medications was determined by the patient's primary team. Study drug was blinded with an
      identical appearing placebo. The first study drug dose (rosuvastatin or placebo) was
      administered within 4 hours of randomization as a loading dose of 40 mg.

      Blood pressure, heart rate, ventilation settings, and various blood factors were measured
      during treatment. Phone-based follow-up assessments occurred at months 6 and 12 after ICU
      discharge and included measurements of health-related quality of life; psychological,
      neurocognitive, and physical activity outcomes; healthcare utilization; and mortality.

                  Arterial Wedge Pressure (PAOP) less than or equal to 18 mm Hg. If a patient has a
                  PAOP > 18 mmHg, then the other criteria must persist for more than 12 hours after
                  the PAOP has declined to ≤ 18 mmHg, and still be within the 48-hour enrollment
                  window.

        ""Acute onset"" is defined as follows: the duration of the hypoxemia criterion (#1) and the
        chest radiograph criterion (#2) must be ≤ 28 days at the time of randomization. Opacities
        considered ""consistent with pulmonary edema"" include any patchy or diffuse opacities not
        fully explained by mass, atelectasis, or effusion or opacities known to be chronic (> 28
        days). The findings of vascular redistribution, indistinct vessels, and indistinct cardiac
        borders are not considered ""consistent with pulmonary edema"".

        All ALI criteria (3a-d above) must occur within the same 24 hour period. The onset of ALI
        is when the last ALI criterion is met. Patients must be enrolled within 48 hours of ALI
        onset and no more than 7 days from the initiation of mechanical ventilation. SIRS criteria
        must occur within the 72 hours before or the 24 hours after ALI onset. Information for

      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Adjuvant
      radiation therapy may kill any remaining tumor cells following surgery or radiosurgery for
      brain metastases.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying surgery or radiosurgery alone to see how
      well it works compared to surgery or radiosurgery and whole-brain radiation therapy in
      treating brain metastases in patients with solid tumors.
    ",Adjuvant Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Brain Metastases,Metastatic Cancer,Neoplasm Metastasis,"
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Investigate the efficacy and toxicity of adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy after prior
           surgical resection or radiosurgery of 1 to 3 brain metastases from solid tumor in
           patients with good performance status and controlled systemic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated on this
           protocol.

        -  Determine time to neurologic progression in patients treated on this protocol.

        -  Determine quality of life of patients treated on this protocol.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating
      center, number of brain metastases (single vs multiple), type of primary tumor (stable
      systemic cancer vs synchronous or unknown primary), WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2), and
      treatment (prior surgical resection vs planned radiosurgery).

      Patients who have undergone complete surgical resection are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms within 4 weeks after surgery.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT).

        -  Arm II: Patients do not receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Patients planning to undergo
           radiosurgery are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm III: Patients undergo radiosurgery followed by adjuvant WBRT within 4 weeks after
           surgery.

        -  Arm IV: Patients undergo radiosurgery alone. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at
           8 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      After completion if study treatment, patients are followed at 8 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 340 patients (85 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3.5 years.

      Some cancer patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen are likely to develop blood clots,
      also known as venous thromboembolism (VTE). Blood clots can cause symptoms and can
      occasionally be life-threatening. The purpose of this study is to determine if a daily
      injection of a blood-thinner, dalteparin, for 12 weeks can safely and effectively reduce the
      frequency of blood clots. Dalteparin is currently approved for prevention of blood clots
      following surgery and in hospitalized patients but not specifically for cancer outpatients.

      VTE is an increasingly frequent complication of cancer and anti-cancer therapies. It is
      associated with increased mortality and other significant adverse consequences. Risk factors
      for VTE in the cancer population have been identified, and multiple studies have also shown
      that VTE can be prevented in high-risk populations with the use of thromboprophylaxis. This
      study evaluated the safety and efficacy of prophylaxis in a high-risk subgroup of cancer
      patients identified by a validated risk model developed by us previously called the ""Khorana
      Score."" Correlative studies evaluated the value of tissue factor as a predictive biomarker of
      VTE. The purpose of this study was to conduct a prospective, randomized clinical trial
      comparing the safety and efficacy of prophylaxis with dalteparin to no treatment in reducing
      VTE in high-risk ambulatory cancer patients initiating chemotherapy and to establish the
      value of TF as a predictive marker for VTE in ambulatory cancer patients receiving
      chemotherapy.

      PHACS was a randomized multi-center clinical trial. Eligible patients were enrolled and
      underwent baseline screening ultrasonography of the lower extremities to rule out
      pre-existing DVT and a chest CT scan to rule out PE. If negative, patients were then
      randomized to receive either dalteparin 5000 units subcutaneously daily or observation for a
      study period of 12 weeks. The first day of dalteparin prophylaxis coincided with the first
      day of initiation of a new systemic chemotherapy regimen. The patients were seen every 4
      weeks (±1 week) at the time of regularly scheduled chemotherapy cycle visits for serial
      ultrasonography of lower extremities during study period (i.e. at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.) A chest
      CT scan was performed at 12 weeks. Compliance was measured by asking patients about missed
      doses at these 4-weekly visits as well as by asking patients to fill an injection diary.

      Rett syndrome (RTT) is a disorder in which the nervous system does not develop properly. RTT
      generally affects girls, but there are some boys who have been diagnosed with RTT. Symptoms
      of RTT include small brain size, poor language skills, repetitive hand movements, and
      seizures. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two drugs in treating the symptoms of
      RTT.
    ",Independent Studies of Dextromethorphan and of Donepezil Hydrochloride for Rett Syndrome,Rett Syndrome,"['Rett Syndrome', 'Syndrome']","
      RTT is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by apparently normal early development
      followed by loss of purposeful hand use, distinctive hand stereotypies, slowed brain growth,
      loss of language, respiratory irregularities, GI disturbances, gait abnormalities, seizures,
      and mental retardation. These symptoms appear between ages 6 and 18 months (stage 2 of the
      disease) following apparently normal development (stage 1). Subsequently, there is gradual
      stabilization of severe mental retardation and motor compromise (stage 3). The majority (70%
      to 80%) of patients demonstrate mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MeCP2) gene, a
      transcription repressor located on chromosome Xq28. The disorder predominantly affects
      females, but a few males with mutations in MeCP2 have been identified, even though many of
      them do not have the classic symptoms recognized in females.

      Recent studies demonstrate increased brain N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in stages 2
      and 3 of the disease. This age-specific increase in glutamate levels and their receptors
      contribute to brain damage. This first study will examine the effectiveness of
      dextromethorphan, an NMDA receptor antagonist, to ameliorate symptoms. Participants will be
      randomized to receive one of three doses of dextromethorphan. All participants will be
      admitted to the hospital for three days at the beginning of the study. During the
      hospitalization, participants will undergo physical exam, Dexascan, MRI, EEG, behavioral
      assessment, laboratory testing, and neuropsychological evaluations. Six months after baseline
      assessment, participants will be rehospitalized for 3 days for similar assessments.

      Reduction in choline acetyltransferase activity in RTT patients may also contribute to
      disturbed cortical development and psychomotor retardation in RTT. Therefore, the second part
      of the study will evaluate the effect of donepezil hydrochloride, an inhibitor of
      acetylcholine-esterase, on acetylcholine levels. This portion of the study will not begin
      until pharmacokinetic data for donepezil in children is available.

      regimen on insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) physiology, and study the relationship
      between IGF-I physiology and outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating institution,
      when and whether they receive adjuvant chemotherapy, axillary lymph node status, and hormone
      receptor status. All patients are randomized within 12 weeks of definitive surgery. Patients
      receiving adjuvant chemotherapy prior to protocol treatment are randomized within 6 weeks
      after the last dose of chemotherapy. One group of patients receives daily oral tamoxifen,
      while a second group receives daily oral tamoxifen plus octreotide (long-acting release
      formulation) by monthly depot injection. Treatment in both groups continues for 5 years or
      until disease recurrence or development of a second malignancy. Patients are followed monthly
      for 4 months, every 4 months for 3 years, and every 6 months thereafter.

      Hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone are diuretics that are commonly in preterm infants
      with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hyponatremia (low blood salt) is a common side effect.
      It is uncertain whether the best way to treat the hyponatremia is by oral salt
      supplementation or restricting fluid intake. Our hypothesis is that fluid restricted infants
      will be better able to preserve the beneficial effects of diuretics on the lungs. The study
      will include very low birth weight infants (VLBW) 400-1500g from Hermann Memorial Children's
      Hospital NICU or LBJ General Hospital NICU with BPD. They will be enrolled and randomly
      assigned to either the salt supplementation group or the fluid restriction group once they
      become hyponatremic (defined as serum Na <130). The study intervention will take place for

      Study Question:

      Among very low birth weight infants, 400-1500 g, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who develop
      hyponatremia while receiving hydrochlorothiazide diuretics: does oral sodium supplementation
      compared to fluid restriction affect FiO2 requirements (change in Respiratory Index Score
      [RIS] in Ventilated or CPAP babies, or change in FiO2 in spontaneously breathing babies)
      after four weeks?

      Randomization Method:

      Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to either the sodium supplementation group or the
      fluid restriction group once they become hyponatremic (serum sodium < 130) while taking
      hydrochlorothiazide.

      Interventions:

      Sodium Supplementation: Patients randomized to the sodium supplementation group will receive
      oral NaCl added to their feeds. When the serum sodium is 125-130, they will have 2 meq/kg/day
      of NaCl added to their feeds. If the serum sodium is 120-124, they will have 4 meq/kg/day of
      NaCl added to their feeds. Na supplementation will continue until the serum Na is >135.

      Fluid Restriction: Patients randomized to the fluid restriction group will have fluid intake
      decreased by 20cc/kg/day. In order to maintain approximately the same caloric intake, 0.5
      cc/kg/dose of corn oil (8.4kcal/cc), will be administered as a bolus every 6 hours. If this
      fluid restriction doesn't increase the serum sodium to above 130 within one week or if the
      serum Na is 120-124 and if the infant is receiving > 140 cc/kg/d, the fluid intake will be
      decreased by an additional 10cc/kg/day for one additional week.

      Outcome Assessments Primary Outcome - the change in FiO2/RIS between baseline and outcome at
      4 weeks after enrollment.

      Secondary Outcomes

        1. 24-hour urine sodium, calcium, and creatinine at 4 weeks.

        2. The mean serum Na+ nadir for each group.

        3. The mean serum K+ nadir for each group.

        4. Time to extubation for infants ventilated at enrollment.

        5. Time on CPAP or mechanical ventilation for infants on CPAP at enrollment.

      Sample Size:

      The estimated sample size for the study will be 58, based on an effect size of 10% if the
      mean FiO2 is 40% (0.1 x 40= 4% absolute difference), expected standard deviation of 5% for
      FiO2, alpha (two-sided) = 0.05; Beta = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.

      Analysis:

      The following analysis plan has been designed to allow every randomized infant to be included
      in the analysis (intention-to-treat analysis) regardless of whether they are intubated,
      extubated, taken off or put onto CPAP, or if they die during the course of the 4-week study
      period. All infants (both study groups combined) will be assigned a rank at baseline and at
      outcome (4 weeks) within each of the following subgroups: infants on O2 by oxyhood, infants
      on nasal cannula, infants on CPAP, infants on the ventilator, infants who die during the
      study. For each infant, a change in rank (outcome minus baseline) will be calculated. The
      change in rank will be compared between the two study groups using a non-parametric test.

      Known to reduce analgesics and length of hospitalization in conventional surgery, laparoscopy
      is characterized by frequent post-operative pain and can decrease the patient's quality of
      immediate postoperative life and sometimes the results of decision ambulatory care.

      In order to reduce these postoperative pain, various methods have been evaluated in numerous
      studies to determine their analgesic role.

      As part of abdominal surgery, local anesthetics (Naropin (Ropivacaine)) are generally
      administered in the end of surgery to reduce postoperative pain and promote recovery of the
      patient. In addition, it is also possible to instill the anesthetic directly into the
      abdominal cavity reducing pain transmitted by nociceptor viscera.

      In recent years, new methods have been proposed such as lung recruitment maneuvers and the
      instillation of saline solution to reduce postoperative pain.

      However, no recommendation is on the use of intraperitoneal saline under the management of
      postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in ambulatory care.

      This study aims to investigate the effect of angiotensin II on microcirculation and
      peripheral perfusion in patients with septic shock.
    ",Angiotensin II for Septic Shock Treatment,Septic Shock,"['Shock, Septic', 'Shock']","
      Shock is a syndrome characterized by acute circulatory failure resulting in impaired
      peripheral tissue perfusion. Distributive shock is the most common type of shock and is
      usually caused by severe sepsis. Distributive shock is characterized by profound
      vasodilatation leading to decreased arterial blood pressure and impaired organ perfusion
      despite high cardiac output.

      The use of vasopressors is an essential management line for distributive sock. Two groups of
      vasopressors are usually used for management of shock: catecholamines and vasopressin-like
      peptides. There is a continuous need for other vasopressors because:

      1- Available vasopressors have narrow therapeutic window. 2- Patients with severe hypotension
      refractory to the currently available classes usually die.

      A third system is usually engaged in the physiology of shock which is
      Renin-Angiotensin-aldosterone system. Angiotensin II is a natural hormone which is a potent
      vasopressor; moreover, angiotensin II stimulates the production of both antidiuretic hormone
      and adrenocorticotropin hormone.

      In a pilot study, angiotensin II was reported as an effective rescue vasopressor in septic
      shock patients on multiple vasopressors. Angiotensin II improved mean arterial pressure and
      helped in reduction of the doses of catecholamines. In a recent large randomized controlled
      trial, angiotensin II improved blood pressure in catecholamine-resistant distributive shock
      patients.

      Microcirculation is the primary site of oxygen and nutrient exchange. Maintenance of
      microcirculatory perfusion is a prerequisite for preservation of organ function. Multiple
      organ failure is common in patients with distributive shock despite maintenance of parameters
      of global perfusion due to disrupted microcirculatory perfusion. Furthermore, restoration of
      microcirculatory perfusion was correlated with improvement in survival. This study aims to
      investigate the effect of angiotensin II on peripheral microcirculation in patients with
      septic shock.

      Background : Numerous studies have outlined the cellular pleiotropic effects of
      erythropoietin (EPO) and their role in the prevention of ischemic-reperfusion lesion such as
      after acute ischemic injury of the brain or the heart. However, most of these studies were

      similar beneficial effects in human pathology.

      Abstract : Since the discovery that EPO and its receptor are expressed in various tissues,
      numerous studies have demonstrated that EPO is not only involved in erythropoiesis but also
      exerts pleiotropic effects on cells. Among these, one of the most exciting is its role in the
      prevention of ischemic-reperfusion lesions such as after acute ischemic injury of the brain
      or the heart. However, most of these studies were carried out in animal models and no
      definitive proof exists today to demonstrate that EPO has similar beneficial effects in human
      pathology. Kidney transplantation is one ischemic situation where EPO pleiotropic effects
      could be of great interest since ischemic-reperfusion lesions have been involved in delayed
      graft function and impaired graft outcomes.

      The aim of this prospective randomized double blind study is to assess the effect of 100 000
      UI of béta-epoiétin on kidney graft function, given to the deceased donor one hour before the
      retreaval of the organ. Recipients will be followed for three months in order to evaluate
      kidney function (glomerular filtration rate) and the number of acute rejection episodes to
      determine whether beta-epoietin could modify the immunogenicity of the graft.

      Aromatase is an enzyme expressed in tissues such as muscle and fat in postmenopausal women.
      These non-ovarian tissues become the dominant sources of estrogen in postmenopausal women.
      Breast cancer cells are often very dependent on estrogens to continue to grow. Atamestane
      blocks the formation of estrogens from androgenic precursors in the body via the aromatase
      enzyme. Toremifene blocks circulating and intracellular estrogens from stimulating estrogen
      receptors in breast cancer cells. The goal of therapy with atamestane, an aromatase
      inhibitor, in combination with the estrogen receptor antagonist, toremifene, is to achieve
      complete suppression of estrogen stimulation of breast cancer cells. This study is designed
      to determine whether combined hormonal therapy will lengthen the time to disease progression
      and the rate of objective response, as compared to single agent therapy with the approved
      aromatase inhibitor letrozole.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether buspirone compared to acetazolamide and to
      placebo will reduce the number and/or severity of breathing pauses during sleep that occur in
      some patients with Heart Failure.
    ",Buspirone as a Potential Treatment for Recurrent Central Apnea,"['Central Apnea', 'Heart Failure']","['Apnea', 'Sleep Apnea, Central']","
      The hypothesis is that buspirone is a safe, effective drug to reduce the occurrence of
      recurrent central apnea and irregular breathing found in the setting of heart failure. A
      secondary hypothesis is that its effect will be similar to that or acetazolamide. Study
      Design: A one-dose double-blind crossover study of buspirone vs. placebo vs. acetazolamide
      will be performed to determine if active drug alters the number and/or severity of recurrent
      central apneas and hypopneas (AHI) in patients with heart failure. AHI is the primary outcome
      variable. In the initial phase of this study, we will recruit 18-20 patients to obtain ~15
      complete studies, using the assumption of a ~20% drop-out, to reach a pre-set significance
      level of a 30% reduction in AHI in the drug groups with a power of 0.90 and a p=0.05 by
      post-hoc testing. Power estimates were calculated using the means and SDs derived from the
      population reported the study of acetazolamide by Javaheri et al (2006). A 30% reduction in
      AHI would be meaningful. A 15% dropout rate was present in the study by Javaheri et al
      (2006), but as our study is a three-way comparison, we chose a slightly higher rate. The
      reasons stated in these articles for a drop out included: viral illness, GI upset (on placebo
      or on theophyllin), tired of the sleep studies, and desire to terminate without cause.
      Statistical Analyses. Analysis of variance for repeated measures using Sidak's correction
      will be used to compare placebo, buspirone, and acetazolamide studies. For variables that are
      not normally distributed, Dunn's nonparametric test for multiple comparisons will be used. p
      > 0.05 will be considered significant. Mean values and SDs will be reported. This single
      dose, one night study is called Buspirone as a Potential Treatment for Recurrent Sleep Apnea
      I.

      The randomization will be in a block design, and the analysis will take into account the
      blocked design. We will recruit 30 patients to obtain ~27 complete studies, using the
      assumption of a ~25% drop-out, to reach a pre-set significance level of a 50% reduction in
      AHI in the drug groups with a power of 0.90 and a p=0.05 by post-hoc testing (see Table C
      below). Power estimates were calculated using the means and SDs derived from the population
      reported the study of a one week trial of acetazolamide by Javaheri, values similar to those
      in the drug trial for theophyllin. Our reasoning is that a 50% reduction in AHI would be most
      meaningful. Our drop-out rate in the one-night study is estimated at ~25%.

      Exclusion criteria of use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or
      antidepressants, while necessary because one of the drugs was buspirone, were too stringent
      for completion of this study in the VA setting. Of ~1000 patient charts screens, 8 were
      eventually entered into the trial, so that power criteria were not met. Records are being
      utilized to probe for hidden features in the PSG for use in future drug trials.

      instructed to increase their fluid intake during this period to expedite the clearance of
      stone fragments. There have been studies to show that pain caused by stones is due to smooth
      muscle spasm along the ureters, possibly mediated by alpha-receptors. Alpha-blockers have
      been shown to improve the expulsion of stones and also improve pain relief when used alone,

      Since the 1960's, intraoperative administration of opioids is considered a keystone of
      anesthesia as well as hypnotics and muscle relaxants. Synthetic opioids were introduced to
      achieve hemodynamic stability during anesthesia. They allow an inhibition of the sympathetic
      system without cardiovascular collapse and histamine release. Since then, anesthesia has
      changed from inhalation to multimodal anesthesia with lower doses of hypnotic. In 2017, the
      intraoperative objectives of hypnosis, hemodynamic stability, immobility and anticipation of
      postoperative analgesia can be achieved without opioids. Moreover, opioid administration
      consequences are neither scarce nor benign for the patient. Perioperative opioids are
      associated with nausea and vomiting, sedation, ileus, confusion/delirium, respiratory
      depression, increased postoperative pain and morphine consumption, immunodepression,
      hyperalgesia and chronic postoperative pain. Among these complications, hypoxemia, ileus and
      confusion/delirium are the most frequent.

      Efficacious multimodal analgesia and anesthesia are the basis of successful fast-track
      surgery. These multidrug regimens aim at decreasing postoperative pain, intra- and
      postoperative opioid requirements, and subsequently, opioid-related adverse effects and to
      fasten recovery. Opioid-free postoperative analgesia has been recommended for more than 10
      years. Opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) is based on the idea that hemodynamic stability can be
      achieved without opioids during anesthesia. OFA is multimodal anesthesia associating
      hypnotics, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, local anesthetics, anti-inflammatory
      drugs and alpha-2 agonists (Dexmedetomidine).

      Proofs of the effect of OFA on reducing opioid-related adverse effects after major or
      intermediate non-cardiac surgery are still scarce. We hypothesized that the reduced opioid
      consumption during and after surgery allowed by OFA compared with standard of care will be
      associated with a reduction of postoperative opioid-related adverse events.

      Mitral regurgitation (MR), also known as mitral insufficiency, is a condition in which the
      heart's mitral valve, located between two of the heart's main chambers, does not firmly shut,
      allowing blood to leak backwards within the heart. Improper functioning of the mitral valve
      disrupts the proper flow of blood through the body, resulting in shortness of breath and
      fatigue. When mild, MR may not pose a significant danger to a person's health, but severe MR
      may be associated with serious complications, such as heart failure, irregular heart rhythm,
      and high blood pressure. Although there are treatments for MR, including medication and
      surgery, more information is needed on the effectiveness of these treatments in people with
      significant MR. This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of corrective surgery
      added to optimal medical treatment (OMT) versus OMT alone in treating people with significant
      MR caused by an enlarged heart.
    ",Effectiveness of Surgical Mitral Valve Repair Versus Medical Treatment for People With Significant Mitral Regurgitation and Non-ischemic Congestive Heart Failure,"['Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Heart Failure']","['Heart Failure', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency']","
      It is estimated that approximately 4 out of 10 people with an enlarged heart due to heart
      failure develop MR, referred to as secondary MR. This type of MR is caused by enlargement of
      the left ventricle (LV), one of the heart's main chambers. In turn, the enlargement leads to
      stretching of certain heart muscles around the mitral valve and of the valve itself. Symptoms
      of secondary MR may include shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, swollen feet, cough, and
      heart palpitations. Mitral valve repair or replacement surgery is sometimes considered as a
      treatment option to restore proper heart function in people with secondary MR. Surgical
      repair with placement of an artificial ring around the mitral valve can help to tighten the
      valve and add benefit to non-surgical treatments for MR. However, although surgical placement
      of the ring improves mitral valve function in most people, it is not known whether this
      surgery helps people live longer and healthier lives. This study will compare the safety and
      effectiveness of surgical mitral valvuloplasty with placement of an annular ring (SMVR) added
      to optimal medical treatment (OMT) versus OMT alone in non-ischemic heart failure patients
      with significant secondary MR.

      Participation from baseline through follow-up in this study will last 18 months. All
      potential participants will initially undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram to confirm the
      presence of an abnormal mitral valve. Eligible participants will then undergo a number of
      baseline tests, which will include cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing, a chest wall
      echocardiogram, blood draw, 6-minute walk test, medical questionnaires, and a physical exam.
      Next, participants will be randomly assigned to receive immediate open heart surgery with the
      placement of a mitral valve ring, delayed surgery at least 18 months later, or OMT.
      Participants assigned to receive immediate surgery will undergo the surgery 2 weeks after
      baseline testing. Participants assigned to receive OMT will receive treatment with any of the
      following medication regimens: combination of vasodilator therapy and diuretics, nitrates and
      nifedipine, and beta-adrenergic blocker therapy. Follow-up visits for all participants will
      occur at Months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 and will include repeat baseline testing. Long-term
      survival status data may be collected beyond 18 months for some participants.

      The purpose of this study is to see if giving the anti-HIV drug nevirapine (NVP) to
      HIV-positive pregnant women and their babies can help reduce the chance that a mother will
      give HIV to her baby during delivery.

      Previous studies suggest that NVP is a promising medication for blocking HIV transmission
      from HIV-positive mothers to their babies.
    ",A Study of Nevirapine to Prevent HIV Transmission From Mothers to Their Babies,"['HIV Infections', 'Pregnancy']",HIV Infections,"
      NVP has several properties that make it an attractive candidate for antiretroviral therapy to
      interrupt HIV-1 transmission in the intrapartum and early post-partum period. The
      pharmacokinetic profile suggests that NVP would be rapidly absorbed and transferred to the
      infant in utero when given during labor and delivery. The HIV-1 antiviral activity is rapid
      with significant reduction in plasma virus occurring within a few days of drug
      administration. In addition, NVP has been shown to penetrate cell-free virions and inactivate
      virion-associated RT in situ. This property would be potentially useful in inactivating
      cell-free virions in the genital tract as well as in breast milk. These characteristics of
      NVP suggest that treatment of an HIV-infected pregnant woman in labor with an oral dose of
      NVP may provide a prophylactic level of NVP in the infant during the time of exposure to
      virus in the birth canal and/or maternal blood. In addition, NVP may inactivate the
      virion-associated RT present in cell-free virions in the genital tract or breast milk.

      Mothers are randomized to receive either a single oral dose of NVP during labor or the
      corresponding NVP placebo. Randomization occurs at any time after the 28th week of gestation.
      To assure balance between the treatment groups, the randomization is stratified using 2
      factors: 1) use of antiretroviral therapy during the current pregnancy (no antiretroviral
      therapy at all; monotherapy [with no multi-agent therapy] for any duration; multi-agent
      therapy for any duration), and 2) CD4 cell count at the time of randomization (less than 200
      cells; 200 to 399 cells; 400 cells or greater). Mothers are followed on-study for 4 to 6
      weeks postpartum.

      Due to the results of ACTG 076 and 185, all women for entry into ACTG 316 are encouraged to
      incorporate a regimen of zidovudine (ZDV) into their current treatment regimen and should
      continue ZDV during delivery and to their neonates (for at least 6 weeks post-birth).

      Infants receive a single oral dose of NVP (or the corresponding placebo) administered between
      48 and 72 hours of life. The infant's study drug is the same as the mother's randomized

      This COVID-19 pandemic warrants urgent strategies to protect people at high risk of
      infection, particularly the healthcare workers. Secondary prevention through post-exposure
      prophylaxis (PEP) and early treatment of infection are needed to prevent severe cases and cut
      secondary transmission. Hydroxycholoroquine (HCQ) is an inexpensive anti-malarial drug with
      immunomodulatory effects that are currently used as an off-label treatment for symptomatic
      COVID-19 patients. In vitro studies have shown that it can efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2
      infection and has potential as a post-exposure prophylaxis drug.

      This study is designed to explore the use of myfortic ® in patients with active lupus
      erythematosus. Similar drugs in this class are increasingly used in organ transplantation and
      in autoimmune diseases. With the established safety profile of myfortic ® in
      allo-transplantation and the already existing data of mycophenolate mofetil in autoimmune
      diseases, this study should help to demonstrate the beneficial effect of myfortic ® on lupus
      activity. The aim of the study will be to show a decreased disease activity with myfortic ®
      compared to standard maintenance therapy with azathioprine.
    ",Myfortic Versus Azathioprine in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic","
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex and potentially life-threatening disease that
      affects about 40 per 10,000 people in the general population (Mills 1994, Brown & Schrieber
      1996). SLE is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by auto-antibody overproduction
      and other distinct immunological abnormalities (Boumpas, et al 1995, Mohan & Datta 1995). It
      may affect the skin, joints, lungs, heart, serous membranes, nervous system or other organs.
      Improvements in treatment over the last decade have increased 10-year survival rates in
      Western countries to 90% or more, and 20-year survival rates of nearly 70% have also been
      reported (Abu-Shakra, et al 1995).

      Newer treatment strategies include the use of novel immunosuppressive agents, such as
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). MMF has been widely used in solid-organ transplantation
      (Sollinger 1995, The Tricontinental Mycophenolate Mofetil Renal Transplantation Study Group
      1996). MMF also has been used increasingly in autoimmune diseases (e.g., dermatomyositis,
      primary glomerular disease or psoriasis (Epinette, et al 1987, Gelber, et al 2000, Choi, et
      al 2002)).

      MMF is the morpholinoethylester prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA). After oral administration
      MMF is well absorbed and rapidly hydrolyzed to MPA. MPA is a noncompetitive inhibitor of
      inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase (DH). Inhibition of IMPDH leads to the depletion of
      deoxyguanosine triphosphate and a consequent decrease in the level of substrate required for
      DNA polymerase activity. This results in inhibition of DNA production and cell proliferation.
      T and B cells are more dependent on this de novo pathway of purine synthesis because
      alternative salvage pathways are unavailable. Thus, MPA is a selective inhibitor of
      lymphocyte proliferation, especially in activated lymphocytes (Allison & Eugui 2000).

      A limited number of clinical studies have been performed to study the efficacy of MMF in the
      treatment of SLE. Most of these studies involved the treatment of nephritis. Chan, et al
      (2000) showed that the combination of MMF and prednisolone is as effective as a regimen of
      cyclophosphamide and prednisolone followed by azathioprine and prednisolone. Azathioprine and
      MMF as maintenance therapy were compared to cyclophosphamide therapy (Contreras, et al 2004)
      and appeared to be more efficacious and safer than long-term therapy with i.v.
      cyclophosphamide. In this study, it was also noted that patients treated with MMF had
      received lower doses of corticosteroids during maintenance therapy as compared to patients
      treated with azathioprine.

      Recent reports suggest that MMF may also be effective in systemic lupus without severe renal
      involvement.(Pisoni, et al 2005) Yet, the superiority over azathioprine in this patient group
      has not been established. Own observations show that approximately 50% of patients with SLE
      treated with azathioprine have at least some evidence of lupus activity. The aim of this
      study will be to show a decreased lupus activity in patients treated with myfortic ® compared
      to therapy with azathioprine. Data so gathered may be useful in planning future developments
      in this indication

      This is a 12 months, multi-center, 2-treatment arm, parallel-group, randomized, open label
      study in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus currently on azathioprine. The patients
      will be randomized to one of the following two treatment groups:

        -  Maintenance of previous therapy including azathioprine.

        -  Switch to a myfortic ® based regimen: myfortic ® (dose of 1440mg/day) A total of 48
           patients (24 patients per arm) fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
           enrolled in the study from approximately 5 centers in the Netherlands. Screening
           evaluations and assessments will be performed in the period after informed consent has

      The objective of the trial is to determine whether 3 cycles of TP (docetaxel plus cisplatin)

    ",Survival Study of Docetaxel and Carboplatin as Neo-Adjuvant Vs Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Early Stage NSLC,Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,"['Lung Neoplasms', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung']","
      Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancers diagnosed
      worldwide. Surgical resection offers the best chance for cure for those patients diagnosed
      with early-stage disease, however, the vast majority of patients experience eventually
      relapse or metastasis. The rationale of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage
      NSCLC lies in the possibility of eradicating micro-metastasis disease, so it appears to
      improve survival by reducing the occurrence of distant metastases. Meta analysis, CALGB 9633,
      JBR 10 and ANITA trials have shown postoperative (adjuvant) CT after complete resection will
      prolong survival. On the other hand, Depierre et al had conducted a trial to demonstrate
      preoperative (neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC appears to improve survival. We
      need a head to head trial to comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant chemotherapy to answer which

      The purpose of this study is to see whether children who take vitamins along with the
      standard medicine for tuberculosis (TB) recover better and quicker than children who take
      only the standard medicine for TB. Four hundred children ages 6 weeks-5 years, who have been
      diagnosed with tuberculosis, will be enrolled. They will be followed for 2 months after
      treatment for TB. Study procedures may include blood draws, Tuberculin Skin Tests, body
      measurements, gastric aspirates (removal of stomach fluid), physical exams, and
      questionnaires. This study will occur in Tanzania.
    ",Effect of Multivitamin Supplements on Clinical and Immunological Response in Childhood Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,"
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains the single most common infectious disease cause of mortality
      worldwide with evidence that support nutritional status may be associated with poor outcomes
      in TB patients. Data from observational and limited intervention studies support the
      hypothesis that nutritional supplements/micronutrients may be beneficial as well as potential
      treatments in TB. The effect of micronutrient status will be examined in the context of a
      double blinded placebo controlled randomized trial; 400 tuberculosis patients (age 6 weeks to
      5 years) will be randomized to receive either multi-micronutrients or placebo from the start
      of their anti-TB therapy, through 2 months of their anti-TB therapy. The primary objective is
      to evaluate the efficacy of a multivitamin supplement containing vitamins B, C and E on
      weight gain in childhood tuberculosis at 2 months after start of anti-tuberculosis therapy.
      Secondary objectives are to: evaluate the efficacy of a multivitamin supplement containing
      vitamins B, C, and E on clearance of chest x-ray in childhood tuberculosis at 2 months after
      start of anti-tuberculosis therapy; compare the treatment arms with respect to the following
      immunological parameters: ex-vivo lymphocyte proliferation; cytokines production including
      IL-2, IL-12, TNF - alpha, INF-gamma; and CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocyte counts at 2 months after
      start of anti-tuberculosis therapy; assess the validity of Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) for the
      diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis in a population with high BCG coverage and HIV
      prevalence; assess the validity and feasibility of using ""microscopic observation broth drug
      susceptibility (MODS) assay"" of sputum and gastric aspirates in the diagnosis of childhood
      tuberculosis; correlate the above-mentioned immunological markers (IL-2, IL-12, INF-gamma and
      TNF-alpha) with weight gain and chest x-ray at 2 months after start of anti-tuberculosis
      therapy; and compare the immunological response to a supplement containing vitamins B, C and
      E in childhood tuberculosis patients with and without HIV infection. The endpoints of
      interest include immunological parameters like CD4 T lymphocyte count and clinical outcomes
      such as, weight gain and resolution of chest x-ray after 2 months anti-TB therapy.
      Researchers will also examine the utility of these immune response parameters as surrogate
      markers for treatment efficacy in TB, irrespective of nutritional and other risk factors.

      Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and disability in survivors in the
      United States. Short cervical length measured by transvaginal ultrasound has been strongly
      associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. Vaginal progesterone has been proposed as
      a management option to reduce the risk of preterm birth in asymptomatic women with singleton
      gestations without prior preterm birth with a very short cervical length. Short cervix in
      this population is defined as less than or equal to 20 mm, when measured between 18 and 24
      weeks.

      The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and the Society of Maternal Fetal
      Medicine (SMFM) have proposed the use of vaginal progesterone either micronized progesterone
      capsule, 200mg daily, or vaginal progesterone gel, 90 mg daily, in asymptomatic women
      carrying a singleton pregnancy and an incidental finding of short cervix.

      Cervical length is usually measured at time of routine anatomical survey fetal between 18 and
      24 weeks of gestation for the prevention of preterm birth at less than 37 weeks.

      Furthermore, cervical pessary has been used in the prevention of preterm birth for many
      decades in a few studies with promising results. More recently, the Arabin pessary has been
      designed with the sole purpose of prevention of preterm birth in pregnant patients with short
      cervix. It is relatively noninvasive, not operator-dependent and can be easily placed and
      removed in the outpatient setting.

      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that adding the use of the Arabin pessary
      for women identified with short cervix and undergoing the standard of care treatment with
      vaginal progesterone, further decreases the risk of preterm birth.

      This will be a prospective randomized trial using vaginal progesterone alone compared with
      the combination of vaginal progesterone and Arabin pessary in the prevention of preterm
      delivery among women who are incidentally found to have short cervical length. Patients
      diagnosed with short cervical length with no prior history of preterm deliveries during
      routine mid-trimester screening will be enrolled in this study and will be randomized into
      two groups. One group will be given vaginal progesterone only, which is the current standard
      of care in the United States. The second group will receive Arabin cervical pessary, to be
      inserted in the clinic at the time of diagnosis, in addition to daily vaginal progesterone.

      Vaginal progesterone will be 200 mg or 90 mg of Crinone inserted once daily at bedtime in
      both groups, depending on patients' insurance coverage. The participants of the study will be
      followed up in the high risk obstetric clinic as per standard clinic surveillance. They will
      receive the standard prenatal care and treatment when warranted according to their clinic
      conditions.

      Hypothesis:

      The use of Arabin pessary in conjunction with the standard treatment of vaginal progesterone
      is more effective in reducing preterm deliveries at less than 37 weeks in women identified
      with short cervix in mid trimester without other risk factors.

      Primary Objective:

      1. To compare the effectiveness of the combination of vaginal progesterone and Arabin pessary
      in the prevention of preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks compared to vaginal progesterone
      alone.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Evaluate the rate of preterm delivery prior to 28, 32, 34 weeks in both groups.

        2. Evaluate the need for adjunctive interventions such as cervical cerclage, tocolysis,
           antibiotics and Betamethasone in both groups.

        3. To evaluate adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in each study group.

        4. Evaluate neonatal intensive care unit admission and composite neonatal morbidity in each
           study group.

      4.0 Eligibility

      Participants will be recruited from the investigators' clinical practice if they are
      diagnosed with short cervical length equal or less than 20 mm at routine ultrasound screening
      for cervical length during mid-trimester anatomy scan from 18-24 weeks at the UIC ultrasound
      units. Those with cervical length less than or equal to 20 mm will be randomized (1:1) into
      two arms: the vaginal progesterone only group and the combined vaginal progesterone and
      Arabin cervical pessary group. Those with cervical lengths between 20 mm to 25 mm will be
      followed up in 1 week with repeat transvaginal sonogram, according to the unit protocol but
      they will be randomized to either group only if they are diagnosed with shorter cervical
      lengths of 20 mm or less prior to 24 weeks of gestation.

      5.0 Subject Enrollment

        1. All pregnant women 18 years old and above who are diagnosed with short cervix during the
           mid-trimester routine screening for cervical length will be counseled about the
           treatment options and recruited for the study if they give their consent.

        2. They will be recruited at the point of diagnosis of short cervical length at the UIC
           ultrasound unit or high-risk obstetric clinic in Women Health Center.

        3. They will be told that their participation in the study will be voluntary and those
           already in the study can opt out at any stage if they so desired.

        4. Both the participants and those who decline to participate in the study will be treated
           equally according to their clinical demands. Refusal to participate in the study will
           not alter in any way the access to other standard of care as the needs arise.

        5. All participants will be followed up throughout their pregnancy until delivery. The
           study enrollment will be from 18 - 24 weeks when they are diagnosed with short cervical
           length. Final data for each participant will be gathered after delivery.

        6. Those with cervical pessary will have the device removed at 37 completed weeks or if
           they are in labor and any other condition that warrants interruption of the pregnancy.
           Vaginal progesterone will continue up to 36 completed weeks, as per standard of care.

      6.0 Study Design and Procedures

      To review, standard prenatal clinical care at UIC includes a cervical length ultrasound
      evaluation at the time of the routine anatomical fetal survey between 18-24 weeks. When an
      incidental finding of shortened cervical length is made, patients are typically prescribed
      vaginal progesterone. They are then followed at the high-risk OB clinic every 2 weeks until
      delivery. This randomized prospective study compares standard clinical care (vaginal
      progesterone alone) to standard care plus the Arabin pessary (vaginal progesterone + Arabin
      cervical pessary) in the prevention of preterm delivery in pregnant women incidentally found
      to have a significantly shortened cervix between 18 and 24 weeks.

        1. This will be a randomized prospective and open-label study with no placebo control or
           blinding of the participants and the research team members. The study is to compare the
           effectiveness of vaginal progesterone versus combination of vaginal progesterone and
           Arabin cervical pessary in the prevention of preterm delivery among patients with
           incidental shortened cervical length.

        2. As part of standard clinical care, all pregnant patients usually have cervical length
           measurements at the mid-trimester during the anatomy scan from 18 to 24 weeks with the
           GE ultrasound Volusion 8 using the vaginal probe.

             1. Those with short cervix will be counseled and offered the opportunity to
                participate in the study.

             2. All participants will be taught how to use the vaginal progesterone once daily
                prior to bedtime. In addition, those in the combination group will have the
                cervical pessary placed in the clinic right away or within a week if they request
                for more time to brood over their diagnosis and weigh on the option of inserting
                Arabin pessary.

             3. All participants will be followed up in the high-risk obstetric clinic as per
                standard prenatal care. Frequency of follow up visits will be individualized
                depending on patient's need and comorbidities. Participants will be requested to
                bring the remnant of the vaginal progesterone to the clinic to assess compliance.

             4. Participants in the study will continue their prenatal care with UIC high-risk
                obstetric clinic until delivery.

             5. The study recruitment will occur for a period of 2 years starting from November
                2016 to October 2018 or until all the anticipated numbers of study subjects have
                been attained.

             6. There will be 10 % over-sampling to cater for those who will drop out from the
                study or loss to follow up after randomization, and those who delivered in another
                hospital.

             7. Participants will have access to one of the investigators or the high- risk clinic
                nurse for any complaints related to their conditions.

             8. Participants can opt out at any stage from the study if they do not want to
                continue further or if there are any adverse effects.

      Studies involving use of product

      This study uses the Arabin cervical pessary and vaginal progesterone (Endometrin 200 mg or
      Crinone 90 mg gel).

      Arabin cervical pessary:

      This is a tissue tolerant non-allergic silicone ring plastic device with a cup-like shape
      used for cervical insufficiency. It comes in various sizes and it is classified according to
      its size:

      The lower larger diameter (65 or 70 mm) The height (17, 21, 25 or 30 mm) The upper small
      diameter (32 or 35 mm)

      The Arabin cervical pessary can easily be folded and inserted in the upper vaginal around the
      cervix without pain. The majority of the patients receive a device size of 32 mm of the upper
      diameter, 21 mm for height and 65 mm for lower diameter. However, participants with
      significantly funneling of the cervical canal will receive a device of 35 mm of the upper
      diameter while those with previous vaginal deliveries will receive a device with lower
      diameter of 70 mm. The length of the vaginal component of the cervix will determine the
      height of the Arabin pessary to be inserted. Before the applications, participants will be
      screened and treated for any cervical or vaginal infections. All participants will be
      screened for bacterial vaginosis, candida infection and Trichomonas, and positive tests will
      receive appropriate treatments, as per standard of care.

      The proposed Arabin cervical pessary will be: Vaginal pessary, CE 0482 MED CERT, EN ISO
      13485. Center for Research and Development. Alfred-Herrhausen Str. 44 D 58455 Witten,
      Germany. Phone: +49 2 302 / 189214. The device will be given to every participant randomized
      to the pessary group free of charge.

      Vaginal pessaries have been used for many years in gynecology for non-surgical treatment of
      utero-vaginal prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. Different types of pessary based on
      the indication and the pelvic anatomical defect have been used. Some of the pessaries that
      have been used in gynecology include: ring, ring with support, Gehrung, Gellhorn, Shaatz,
      Donut, Cube and inflatable. Vaginal pessaries like Donut and ring with support have been used
      in pregnancy for the management of cervical insufficiency. However, the pitfall in the use of
      these pessaries is that they are easily expelled due to the anatomical changes of the vagina
      in pregnancy that make it difficult for them to fit well in the vagina. With the introduction
      of Arabin cervical pessary which is designed to allow it wrap around the cervix instead of
      just placing it in the vagina negate this pitfall. Arabin cervical pessary have been used for
      many years in Europe for the prevention of preterm delivery in women with cervical
      incompetence. A Cochrane review by Abdel -Aleem in 2013 showed that Arabin cervical pessary
      has beneficial effects in reducing preterm birth in women with short cervix, (Abdel-Aleem et
      al 2013, Liem S et al 2013 and Ting YH et al 2012). This is a non-invasive, and not
      operator-dependent silicone plastic that is inserted in the vagina to wrap around the cervix
      thereby preventing it from shortening and dilating. It can easily be placed or removed in an
      outpatient clinic and it does not require anesthesia. It does not need to be removed for
      examinations. Premature cervical shortening and dilatation is one of the most important
      causes of preterm birth. This device does not have systemic adverse effects and the only
      complaints reported by some of the users is slightly increase vaginal discharge. In another
      study of systematic review of the efficacy of Arabin cervical pessary, it showed that
      majority of the patients; > 90 % expressed great satisfaction with the device and they will
      recommend it to other patients (Sophie M et al 2013).

      Endometrin or Crinone vaginal progesterone (Ferring Reproductive Health):

      Endometrin (progesterone vaginal insert) is a vaginal insert containing 100 mg of micronized
      progesterone. Crinone is a vaginal gel (8%) with 90 mg of micronized progesterone.
      Progesterone is a natural hormone that is often used in pregnancy for various indications.
      One of the indications is for prevention of preterm deliveries in women with short cervical
      length. It is usually well tolerated except for some minor side effects such as allergic
      reactions to some of its components, itching, headache or flushing.

      7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits

      The expected risks include:

        1. If randomized to the pessary group, vaginal erosion of the pessary is possible, but this
           is extremely rare since the device is soft and with little pressure on the vaginal wall.
           This has never been an observed side-effect in any patients in investigators clinic that
           have been using this device for over a year. Moreover, all participants will have access
           to one of the investigators 24 hours a day and 7 days a week to express any complaints
           or concerns. In the event that participants feel discomfort with the pessary and they
           desire to discontinue, the participant will be required to come to the clinic for
           evaluation and possible removal of the pessary.

        2. Allergic reaction to components of vaginal progesterone is also an extremely rare
           adverse event. The most common sign of allergic reaction is itching. If this occurs,
           participants will come to the OB ER for immediate evaluation or come to the high risk OB
           clinic where they will be evaluated and treated accordingly. As vaginal progesterone is
           prescribed to most women with an incidental finding of shortened cervical length, this
           risk is no greater than standard clinical care.

        3. There is the possibility of increased vaginal discharge from both the daily use of
           vaginal progesterone and also from the Arabin pessary. While there is also the
           possibility of infection, this is extremely rare. Participants will be counseled prior
           to commencement about the possibility of slightly increased vaginal discharge while they
           are on either or both interventions.

        4. There has been report of unsuccessful placement of Arabin pessary. A study done in
           Belgium in 2013 reported successful placement of Arabin pessary of 82.2 % at first
           attempt and 90.4 % at second attempt (Cannie MM et al, Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 2013;
           42: 426 - 433). However, the investigators experience with the use of this device at UIC
           as part of the investigators clinical care has been very encouraging. The investigators
           have never encountered any unsuccessful attempt at placing the Arabin pessary. This may
           be largely due to the introduction of a newer version of the device in 2015 which is
           softer, and more flexible. There are also three different sizes of this device. If any
           of the investigators encounter difficulty in placing this device in investigator first
           attempt, it will be withdrawn and the investigator may place the next smaller size of
           the device. If this is still not successful, the investigator will place the device
           under direct visualization of the cervix using a vaginal speculum or allow another
           investigator to attempt placing the device.

      Acute tramatic pain is one of main reasons for consultation in pediatric emergency
      departments.

      To manage pain quickly and effectively must be a primary outcome of the emergency department.
      However, pediatric emergency department are sometimes criticized for inadequate and delayed
      initiation analgesia . Indeed, several studies have shown the inadequacy between the
      intensity of the pain evaluated by the care team and the therapeutic management of it.

      The ideal analgesic must have a rapid onset of action, have a powerful analgesic effect, have
      few side effects and can be administered quickly and painlessly. That's why, the main outcome
      of this study is to assess the non inferiority of a treatment by intranasal Fentanyl vs

      Severe alcoholic hepatitis is defined as alcoholic hepatitis patients having discriminant
      function (DF) score over 32 or accompanying hepatic encephalopathy. These patients have shown
      poor prognosis of 28 day mortality as 30 to 50% without treatment. Steroid (prednisolone

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      rituximab and alemtuzumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some find cancer cells
      and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Others interfere with the
      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving fludarabine
      and cyclophosphamide together with rituximab is more effective than giving fludarabine and
      cyclophosphamide together with alemtuzumab in treating B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving fludarabine together with
      cyclophosphamide and rituximab to see how well it works as first-line therapy compared with
      giving fludarabine together with cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab in treating patients with

      Atrial fibrillation remains a major cause of morbidity following cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Many mechanisms have been implicated. Among then, adenosine, a strong
      endogenous vasodilating agent has been involved in cardiac surgery-induced atrial
      fibrillation, via A2A receptors modulation.

      The effects of caffeine on the inducibility of atrial fibrillation are actually well-known,
      leading then to a significant reduction of atrial fibrillation. Moreover, a recent clinical
      study has demonstrated that coffee drinking was inversely associated with total and
      cause-specific mortality.

      The investigators therefore examined the preventive effects of oral caffeine on valvular
      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass-induced atrial fibrillation. The investigators also
      evaluated prospectively the influence of caffeine on adenosine plasma levels and A2A
      adenosine receptors modulation.

      The purpose of this study is to test in patients who have had hip replacement surgery the
      effectiveness (level of pain control) and the safety of 3 different dose levels of CG5503
      compared with placebo and with 10-mg oxycodone during the 72-hour double-blind period and to
      assess the safety of the drug for 9 days after patients completed the double blind period.
    ",A Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness and Safety of Tapentadol(CG5503) in the Treatment of Acute Pain After Hip Replacement Surgery Compared With Oxycodone and Placebo Followed by a Voluntary Open-Label Extension For Safety,Arthroplasty,Acute Pain,"
      Patients undergoing hip replacement often experience moderate to severe acute pain
      post-surgery. Normally such pain is controlled when patients receive repeated doses of opioid
      analgesics. However, opioid therapy is commonly associated with side effects such as nausea,
      vomiting, sedation, constipation, addiction, tolerance, and respiratory depression. CG5503, a
      newly synthesized drug also acts as a centrally acting pain reliever but has a dual mode of
      action. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness (level of pain control) and
      safety (side effects) of 3 dose levels of CG5503, in an immediate release, (IR) formulation,
      compared with no drug (placebo) or one dose level of oxycodone (an opioid commonly used to
      treat post-surgical pain). This study is a randomized, double-blind (neither investigator nor
      patient will know which treatment was received), active- and placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the treatment of acute pain from hip
      replacement surgery. The study will include a blinded 72 hour in-patient phase immediately
      following hip replacement surgery, during which patients will be treated with either 50-,
      75-, or 100-mg CG5503 base IR, a placebo, or 10-mg oxycodone, and pain relief will be
      periodically assessed. Following this phase, patients wishing to continue treatment with
      CG5503 IR may enter an outpatient voluntary nonrandomized, open-label extension phase for 9
      days during which they will receive 50- or 100-mg CG5503 IR. Assessments of pain relief
      include the pain intensity numeric rating scale (PI), pain relief numeric rating scale (PAR)
      and patient global impression of change scale (PGIC). Safety evaluations include monitoring
      of adverse events, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. Venous blood samples
      will be collected for the determination of serum concentrations of CG5503 and oxycodone. The
      null hypothesis for the study is that efficacy results for all CG5503 IR dosage groups are
      equal to placebo based on the mean sum of pain intensity difference at 48 hours. The
      alternative study hypothesis is that at least 1 dose strength of CG5503 will be different
      from placebo in controlling pain at 48 hours. CG5503 base IR 50, or 75, or 100 mg, or
      oxycodone 10 mg, or placebo, 1 capsule taken by mouth every 4 to 6 hours during the 72 hour
      postsurgery phase of the study (one extra dose is allowed, if needed for pain); and CG5503,
      50 mg base capsules, 1 to 2 tablets taken by mouth every 4 to 6 hours for up to 9 days during
      the open label portion of the study. All doses of study treatment will be taken with
      approximately 120 mL of water with or with food.

      This randomized phase III trial is studying cisplatin, radiation therapy, and tirapazamine to
      see how well they work compared to cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with
      cervical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and tirapazamine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Internal
      radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells.
      Cisplatin and tirapazamine may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. It is
      not yet known whether giving cisplatin together with radiation therapy is more effective with
      or without tirapazamine in treating cervical cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to FIGO stage of disease (IB2 vs IIA vs IIB vs IIIB vs IVA), brachytherapy method
      (low-dose rate vs high-dose rate), surgical staging of para-aortic nodes (yes vs no).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29,
      and 36 (weeks 1-6). Patients also undergo external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis once daily
      on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, and 29-33 (weeks 1-5). Patients then receive either 1 or 2
      applications of low-dose rate brachytherapy in weeks 6-8 OR 5 applications of high-dose rate
      (HDR)* brachytherapy once weekly in weeks 4-8 and 3-5 days of parametrial boost
      radiotherapy** beginning after the first brachytherapy implant. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 10, 12, 15, 22, 24, 26,
      and 29 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29. Patients also undergo radiotherapy
      and brachytherapy as in arm I. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *No external beam radiotherapy is administered on the day of HDR brachytherapy. If the
      majority of external beam radiotherapy has been administered, HDR brachytherapy may be

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of Mentor's
      Spectra/Becker 80 Adjustable Breast Implants in women who are undergoing primary or revision
      breast augmentation. Safety information on the rate of complications, such as infection, will
      be collected and used to help determine device safety. These implants are investigational
      devices.

      Approximately 450 patients at sites across the United States will be enrolled in this
      research study by up to 30 sites. These patients will be implanted with Spectra/Becker 80
      implant and monitored for 10 years to collect information on risks associated with the
      implant surgery as well as changes in the way these patients feel about themselves.

      Silicone gel-filled breast implants were introduced in the early sixties and were in
      wide-scale distribution by the time the Medical Device Amendments to the Food Drug and
      Cosmetic Act was passed in 1976. In 1983, gel-filled breast implants were designated as Class
      III devices requiring premarket approval. In May 1990, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      published a proposed request (515(b)) for Pre-market Approval Applications (PMA) and in April
      1991 published the final request. This final publication put manufacturers of gel-filled
      breast implants on notice that for continued marketing of gel-filled breast implants, a PMA
      was due to FDA in 90 days from the final publication date.

      A Pre-Market Approval (PMA) for the Mentor gel-filled breast implants was filed with the FDA
      in July 1991. At the FDA General and Plastic Surgery Advisory Committee meeting in November
      1991, the committee recommended the submission of additional information to establish the
      safety and effectiveness of gel-filled breast implants.

      In January 1992, the FDA Commissioner announced a voluntary moratorium of the sale of
      gel-filled breast implants to allow the advisory panel time to assess additional information.
      In April 1992, the moratorium was lifted but only for reconstruction and revision subjects.
      Every subject implanted had to be part of an Adjunct Study, in addition to being offered
      participation in a registry of gel-filled breast implant subjects. The Adjunct Study devices
      included the round MemoryGel, Becker Expander/Prosthesis and the Lumera implants. In order to
      be implanted with gel-filled implants for augmentation, women had to be enrolled in an
      Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) clinical trial.

      A PMA for Mentor's MemoryGel™ Silicone Gel-Filled breast implants (which did not include the
      Becker Expander/Breast Implants) was subsequently filed with FDA in December 2003, and
      approved in November 2006 (P030053). As a condition of approval of P030053, new enrollment in
      Mentor's Adjunct Study has ceased, and women no longer have access to the Becker
      Expander/Breast Implants or any Adjustable Gel-Filled implants. The Spectra/Becker 80
      Adjustable Breast Implants were not included in the Adjunct Study.

      This study is designed to study the safety and effectiveness of Mentor's Spectra/Becker 80
      Adjustable Breast Implants for primary breast augmentation or augmentation revision.

      Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that consuming probiotics can improve mood,
      anxiety, and cognition, as well as alter brain activity in both rodents and healthy humans.
      Data from our recent open-label, 8-week pilot study provided the first evidence of these
      effects in depressed patients, with significant improvements observed in overall mood,
      anhedonia, and sleep quality. To further support this evidence and expand upon the search for
      biomarkers in depression, data from this pilot study is being used to plan a 16-week,
      double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects of probiotics on
      depression. Participants diagnosed with depression recruited from the greater Kingston area
      will orally consume a probiotic supplement containing Lactobacillus helveticus and
      Bifidobacterium longum (Probio'Stick, Lallemand Health Solutions) or placebo once daily.
      Participants will undergo clinical assessments measuring mood, anxiety, cognition, and sleep
      using a battery of validated clinical scales to assess efficacy of the probiotic alleviating
      depressive symptoms; sleep will also be assessed objectively with an ambulatory
      polysomnogram. Neuroimaging data will be collected using magnetic resonance imaging and
      electroencephalography to look at functional, structural, and electrical changes in the brain
      associated with consumption of the probiotic. Molecular data will be collected from blood,
      stool, and urine samples to look at levels of cytokines and serotonin, and explore potential
      genes and proteins that may predict outcomes in depression. An informatics-based approach
      will be used to integrate clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular data to look for biomarkers
      that indicate disease state and predict antidepressant-like response to the probiotic.
      Results: We expect results to replicate and expand on our pilot data, demonstrating that
      probiotics are effective in alleviating symptoms of depression, and to find biomarkers that
      will predict these outcomes. The findings from this study will contribute robust scientific
      data that is currently lacking in this emerging field.

      Over one year period in an area with universal coverage of LLIN and ACT provision as the

      cost-effectiveness estimates of DL and the community acceptability of DL will also be

    ",The Effectiveness of Non-Pyrethroid Insecticide-Treated Durable Wall Liners as a Method for Malaria Control in Endemic Rural Tanzania,Malaria,Malaria,"
      Vector control, together with prompt treatment with an artemisinin-based combination therapy
      (ACT) for individuals diagnosed with malaria and intermittent preventive treatment in
      pregnant women, is a critical component of malaria control in Africa. The two main vector
      control interventions used in Africa are long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor
      residual spraying (IRS). LLINs are currently the mainstay of vector control and are believed
      to have contributed to the recent dramatic decline in malaria cases. However, resistance to
      the pyrethroid insecticides used in the bed nets has increased. The second main vector
      control method, IRS, has been an extremely effective adjunct to LLINs; its usefulness is
      threatened by the high cost of repeated applications and increasing mosquito resistance to
      insecticides used for spraying.

      A new product, durable lining (DL) treated with non-pyrethroid insecticides, has been
      developed by Vestergaard, which theoretically mimics the effect of IRS but is designed to
      last for a minimum of three years. The product consists of a mixture of two non-pyrethroid
      insecticides incorporated into a polymer fabric that are designed to migrate differentially
      over the lifetime of the product to ensure sustained bioefficacy. The use of two agents may
      also decrease the risk of development of resistance. It is estimated that the cost of the
      insecticide treated wall liners (DL), which are installed on the indoor walls of houses,
      would be equal to 2-3 rounds of IRS.

      To test the effectiveness of this new product, we will conduct a two-arm controlled
      randomized cluster trial to test the hypothesis that DL + LLINs are superior to LLINs alone.
      Over twelve (12) months (August 2015- Aug 2016), in an area with universal coverage (UC) of
      LLINs and where artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) are provided as the first-line
      treatment of malaria, we intend to evaluate the impact of DL on malaria transmission among
      children ages 6 months to 11 years as measured by the incidence of malaria parasitemia
      (symptomatic and asymptomatic), and the prevalence of moderate to severe anemia in
      under-fives. In addition, we will assess the effect of DL on entomological parameters, and
      measure the acceptability and a cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Stratified
      randomization based on malaria prevalence during the baseline survey will be used to select
      22 clusters per arm in Muheza district.

      Osteoid osteoma (OO) is a benign osteogenic tumor occurring in children and young adults,
      responsible for intense bone pain, which has a tendency to spontaneously heal with
      mineralization of the nidus, but extremely slowly. This healing may be accelerated in
      patients taking NSAIDs regularly during a few years. The long delay for healing and intense
      pain, explain why patients are quickly directed to surgeons or specialized radiology
      departments for tumor ablation. But percutaneous treatment or surgical excision destruction
      can expose the patient to a substantial risk in terms of neurologic or joint damages,
      depending on the location. Bisphosphonates treatment may be an effective alternative to
      percutaneous treatment by accelerating the natural history of OO.
    ",Zoledronic Acid Compared to Percutaneous Treatment in Osteoid Osteoma,Osteoid Osteoma,"['Osteoma', 'Osteoma, Osteoid']","
      Osteoid osteomas (OOs) are small, benign but painful bone tumors, mainly observed in children
      and young adults. Pain, almost universal, is characteristically greater at night. Pain is
      well relieved by NSAIDs but resolution is not always complete and pain reappears a few hours
      after the last dose. Also long-term consumption of NSAID can lead to serious adverse events.
      Therefore OOs are usually cured shortly after diagnosis, mainly by means of percutaneous
      treatment (PT) under computed tomography (CT) (radiofrequency coagulation or interstitial
      laser ablation).

      The clinical success rate using these techniques is 96% at 6-month, 94% at 24-month. However,
      the technique is not distributed everywhere since it is performed by highly specialized
      interventional radiologists. The PT is performed under general, spinal or regional
      anesthesia. General anesthesia is used in most cases, especially in children. When the OO is
      located in close proximity to the skin, cartilage, vessels and nerves, severe complications
      may occur and additional procedures such as infusion of saline or injection of CO2 at the
      interface between the OO and the vulnerable structure are done. Also few anatomic locations
      are not accessible to a PT.

      The natural history of OOs remains poorly understood. However investigators in small series
      of conservatively treated OOs suggested a spontaneous healing of the lesion with
      mineralization of the nidus and resolution of pain (mean duration of pain in patients with
      NSAID treatment: 33 months NSAID).

      The efficacy of bisphosphonates on pain related to benign (Langherhans cell histiocytosis,
      fibrous dysplasia, Paget disease) or malignant bone lesions has been widely reported. The
      investigators observed such efficacy in a small series of 20 patients with percutaneously
      hard-to-reach or recurrent OO using one to three infusions of zoledronate. The clinical
      efficacy assessed on pain relief was accompanied by a significantly increased mineralization
      of the nidus. The investigators postulated that bisphosphonates had accelerated the natural
      history of OO.

      Our hypothesis is that three infusions of zoledronate (4mg) repeated monthly in patients with
      symptomatic OO is non-inferior to percutaneous treatment on the efficacy, measured by pain
      relief at Visual Analogical Scale (VAS).

      The main objective of this randomized study is to demonstrate that in patients with OO,
      treatment with three intravenous cycles of 4mg of zoledronic acid administered monthly, is
      non-inferior to treatment with percutaneous thermal ablation on the efficacy measured by the
      percentage of pain relief between baseline and end of treatment.

      NB: Patients for whom the OO would not be percutaneously accessible (that is to say when the
      percutaneous treatment or surgical excision destruction expose the patient to a substantial
      risk in terms of neurologic or joint damages) will be offered to participate in a cohort,
      only in Lariboisière and Cochin hospital in Paris. In the cohort, the clinical follow-up will
      be conducted as it is currently proposed in Laribosisière hospital (no act added by the
      research). Objectives of the register will be explained to the patient. It consists in
      collecting anonymized medical data after a bisphosphonate treatment to statuate on the
      efficacy of the bisphosphonates to relieve pain due to osteoid osteoma.

      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether
      gemcitabine hydrochloride and docetaxel are more effective when given with or without

      Malaria is a major contributor of disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa, and pregnant women
      and children are the most vulnerable population. Malaria in pregnancy increases the risks of
      abortion, prematurity, maternal anaemia, low birth weight (LBW), perinatal, neonatal and
      infant mortality. For prevention and control of malaria in pregnancy, Intermittent Preventive
      Treatment (IPT), insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and case management for malaria and anemia

      HIV infection in pregnancy increases the risk of malaria, LBW, post-natal mortality and also

      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), which is the only treatment with proven efficacy and safety
      in IPT and is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Unfortunately, there is a
      documented increase of resistance to SP, so cotrimoxazole (CTX) could be an alternative: many
      studies in Zambia and Uganda demonstrated that it reduces mortality and morbidity in HIV
      infected persons, and CTX prophylaxis significantly improves birth outcomes in
      immuno-suppressed HIV women. Unfortunately, there is not yet information on its effectiveness
      for preventing placental malaria infection, maternal anaemia and LBW. Thus in this study, we
      aim to establish the safety and efficacy of daily CTX in preventing malaria infection during
      pregnancy and its consequences, both in HIV infected and non-infected pregnant women. This
      information is urgently needed to assist to issue guidelines on IPT in pregnancy.
    ",Daily Co-trimoxazole Prophylaxis to Prevent Malaria in Pregnancy,Malaria in Pregnancy,Malaria,"
      Malaria is a major contributor of disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa, with pregnant women
      and children being the most vulnerable population. P. falciparum infection in pregnancy leads
      to parasite sequestration in placental vascular space, with increased risks of abortion,
      stillbirth, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, maternal anaemia, low birth weight
      (LBW), perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality. In low transmission areas, malaria can
      evolve towards severe disease with high risk of mortality. In endemic areas, it is still
      associated with maternal anaemia, LBW and stillbirth. For prevention and control of malaria
      in pregnancy, WHO recommends Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT), insecticide treated
      nets (ITNs) and case management for malaria and anemia.

      HIV in pregnancy increases the risk of malaria, LBW, post-natal mortality and also anaemia,
      suggesting a synergistic interaction between HIV and malaria.

      In pregnant women, HIV-1 infection decreases the efficacy of
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine(SP)IPT, although 2 or more doses in 2nd and 3rd trimesters still
      reduce peripheral parasitaemia, placental infections and maternal anaemia.

      To date, SP is the only treatment with data on efficacy and safety in IPT: WHO recommends at
      least 2 doses after the first trimester. But there is a documented increase in SP resistance,
      so cotrimoxazole (CTX) could be an alternative: many studies in Zambia and Uganda
      demonstrated that it reduces mortality and morbidity in HIV infected individuals, and CTX
      prophylaxis significantly improves birth outcomes in women with CD4 count <200. Concurrent
      administration of SP and CTX has been associated with increased incidence of severe adverse
      reactions in HIV-infected patient.

      WHO has promoted CTX as alternative to SP for IPT in immuno-compromised HIV-infected pregnant
      women. Unfortunately, there is no information on effectiveness of daily CTX for preventing
      placental malaria infection, maternal anaemia and LBW. In the past, CTX has been used to
      treat malaria in children and daily use of CTX by non-pregnant HIV-infected adults has been
      associated with a 70% reductions of the incidence of clinical malaria.

      In this study, we will target both HIV infected and non-infected pregnant women with CD4≥
      200/µL, with the aim to establish the safety and efficacy of daily CTX in preventing malaria
      infection during pregnancy and its consequences, by assuming that CTX is not inferior to SP
      in reducing placental parasitaemia: such information is urgently needed to assist to issue
      guidelines on IPT in pregnant women.

      Misoprostol (Cytotec®) is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analog that has been marketed in the
      United States since 1988 as a gastric cytoprotective agent. Despite a focused campaign by the
      manufacturer to curtail its use in obstetric practice, misoprostol has, over the past several
      years, gained widespread acceptance to effect the medical termination of pregnancy in the
      second trimester, either alone or after pretreatment with mifepristone. The primary reasons
      for this prompt incorporation into standard practice include its low cost and the lack of
      stringent storage requirements.

      Vaginal administration seems to be more efficacious than when given orally. The use of
      sublingual misoprostol for first trimester abortions has been extensively investigated as
      evidenced by the large number of publications comparing sublingual to other routes of
      misoprostol for first trimester pregnancy termination, on the assumption that the sublingual
      route would have a similar efficacy of the vaginal route. In addition, the sublingual route
      would combine an easier administration with the added advantage of no restriction of mobility
      after administration. There has been no previous report in the literature comparing the use
      of misoprostol given sublingually to that given vaginally for the second trimester
      termination following intrauterine fetal death. Our aim is to compare efficacy, safety and
      patient satisfaction with misoprostol given vaginally (the current standard) to that given
      sublingually.
    ",A Randomized Trial of Two Regimens of Misoprostol for Second Trimester Termination for Intrauterine Fetal Death,Labor Induction,"['Fetal Death', 'Stillbirth']","
      Prostaglandins have been recognized as effective abortifacients for several decades.
      Misoprostol, a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1, has several advantages over other
      prostaglandins that include low cost, easy storage at room temperature, and favorable side
      effect profile. In recent years, misoprostol has attracted attention as an effective and
      cost-efficient agent for the medical interruption of the second-trimester pregnancy.
      Nowadays, misoprostol has been accepted widely as a safe and effective agent for labor
      induction during the second trimester. Various doses, routes, and protocols for medical
      termination of pregnancy during the second trimester have been investigated. The optimal
      dosage and route of administration, however, have yet to be defined. Previous studies have
      demonstrated greater efficacy with vaginal misoprostol versus oral administration in
      effecting mid-trimester termination. However, oral administration of any medication is
      preferred by patients and health care providers alike. The higher efficacy after vaginal
      administration may be explained by the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Zeiman et al showed that
      the systemic bioavailability of vaginally administered misoprostol is 3 times higher than
      that after oral administration. Plasma concentrations of its metabolite, misoprostol acid,
      peak one to two hours after vaginal application as compared with the peak seen 30 minutes
      following oral administration, and although peak levels are lower with the vaginal route,
      they are sustained longer and overall exposure to the drug is increased, perhaps because of
      the presystemic gastrointestinal or hepatic metabolism that occurs with the oral route. An
      additional explanation for the higher efficacy could be that there is a direct effect on the
      cervix that initiates the physiologic events that lead to increased uterine contractility.
      The sublingual route of administration has not been reported in the literature prior to 2001.
      Since then and partly because of issues relating to patient preference, investigators started
      studying the sublingual route of administration of misoprostol. In theory, the sublingual
      route could mimic vaginal administration pharmacokinetically, although there have been no
      such reported studies on this route of administration.

      Although many studies have been published on the use of sublingual misoprostol for medical
      abortion in the first trimester, none were done to compare sublingual and vaginal routes in
      the case of second trimester termination for intrauterine fetal death. The 400-µg dose was
      chosen because it is the dose most commonly used orally and vaginally in various studies
      reported in the literature.

      To the best of our knowledge, no study comparing sublingual to vaginal misoprostol for
      termination of pregnancy for intrauterine fetal death in the second trimester has been
      previously published in the literature. Therefore, this study, when completed will provide
      evidence on the relative effect and safety profile of different routes of administration of
      misoprostol for indicated second trimester termination.

      The aim of our study is to compare the efficacy of a 400-µg sublingual dose of misoprostol
      Cytotec® (Searle Pharmaceuticals, Bucks, United Kingdom) administered at 4-hour intervals
      with an equivalent dose regimen administered vaginally in women admitted for second trimester
      termination for intrauterine fetal death. In addition, we want to assess patient
      acceptability of the 2 modes of administration.

      The study hypothesis is that the sublingual route of administration of misoprostol is as
      effective as the vaginal route for induction of labor for mid trimester termination and is
      more acceptable to patients as compared to vaginal misoprostol.

      Randomization procedure:

      The randomization to vaginal or sublingual misoprostol will be based on a computer-generated
      table with the allocation concealed in sealed, sequentially numbered, brown envelopes, which
      had been prepared by the principal investigator that will not be involved in the clinical
      care of the patients. Because of the nature of the misoprostol administration, the patients
      and staff will not blinded to the randomization allocation.

      Routine studies and procedures:

        -  A pelvic exam will be done to make sure that the patient is eligible for inclusion in
           the study (Bishop's score <8).

        -  Maternal pulse, blood pressure, and temperature will be recorded every 4 hours ( at the
           time of the insertion of the Misoprostol).

        -  After delivery of the fetus, all patients will receive 20 units of oxytocin in 1000 mL
           of intravenous crystalloid at an infusion rate of 125 mL per hour.

        -  Postpartum curettage will be performed at the discretion of the physician if the
           placenta had not delivered spontaneously 2 hours after the delivery of the fetus.

        -  Patients will receive intravenous narcotics or epidural anesthesia as needed for pain
           control.

        -  Antiemetics, antipyretics, and anxiolytics will be administered as indicated.
           Interventions: The women will give a full informed consent, after which they will be
           randomized to receive 400 µg of vaginal or sublingual misoprostol Cytotec® (Searle
           Pharmaceuticals, Bucks, United Kingdom) after admission to the induction ward. This dose
           and route of administration will be repeated every 4 hours, if required as long as the
           patient is undelivered up to 48 hours following initiation of induction.

      The induction will be categorized as having failed if the woman was undelivered after 48
      hours and then she would receive extraamniotic PGF2 instillation or high-concentration
      intravenous oxytocin, depending on their cervical status and amniotic membrane integrity.
      Another option would be a further attempt at cervical ripening with vaginal Prostin tablets
      (Upjohn Pharmaceuticals) after an interval of at least four hours following the last dose of
      misoprostol.

      - The women will complete a brief questionnaire using a visual analogue scale to ascertain
      their perceptions of the process in terms of pain, control, and overall opinion of the
      procedure every 12 hours. The women will perform the pain scale assessments with a visual
      analogue ruler scaled from 0 to 10, with 0 representing no perception of pain and 10
      representing the most intense pain ever experienced.

      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS statistical
      package. Categoric data like maternal characteristics will be compared using Chi square when
      sample sizes support the approximation. Otherwise, categorical data will be analyzed with
      two-tailed Fisher exact test if the expected cell frequencies were small. Continuous
      variables will be compared by Student t test if assumptions of normality and homogeneity of
      variances appeared to be reasonable. Unpaired variables and differences in distributions will
      be compared using the Mann-Whitney test. A p-value <0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant.

      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of gabapentin relative to tramadol for the
      treatment of chronic, neuropathic or mixed pain in the paediatric population. Children from 3
      months to less than 18 years of age experiencing moderate to severe chronic pain will receive
      either gabapentin or tramadol for 15 weeks. The difference in average pain scores between
      treatment arms at the end of the treatment period will be assessed.
    ",Study to Compare Gabapentin to Tramadol in Children With Chronic Neuropathic or Mixed Pain,Chronic Pain,Chronic Pain,"
      Gabapentin is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults. In the
      absence of specific paediatric studies, it is not approved for the same condition in
      children.

      The paediatric use of gabapentin is hampered by a) the lack of a suitable paediatric
      formulation, b) the significant variability of gabapentin pharmacokinetics profile and c)
      efficacy and safety data in this specific population.

      The GABA-1 study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy of gabapentin oral solution relative
      to tramadol and to document the Pharmacokinetic and safety profile of gabapentin in this
      indication.

      GABA-1 is a non-inferiority trial because gabapentin is expected to be equally effective but
      better tolerated than tramadol, thus providing a clinical benefit to affected children.

      Total knee and hip replacements are some of the most common orthopedic procedures that
      require aggressive postoperative pain management. This management helps us to improve
      clinical outcomes such as participation in early physical therapy, hospital discharge, and
      patient satisfaction. Based on the recent anatomical evidence and the investigator's
      knowledge of the complexity of the knee joint innervation the investigator proposes a new
      regional anesthesia technique that provides a complete sensory blockade and better analgesia
      while preserving the quadriceps strength and avoiding the potential for foot drop caused by
      inadvertent blockade of the common peroneal nerve.

      bupivacaine (Exparel) in patients undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty. The primary outcome of
      this study is the proportion of patients ""fit to discharge"" on postoperative day one.
      Recently, liposomal bupivacaine (LB) (Exparel) was introduced into clinical practice, using a
      lipid-based depot (DepoFoam) technology for sustained release of bupivacaine. LB (Exparel)
      uses this technology to extend the delivery of bupivacaine, a local anesthetic that has been
      used in clinical practice for decades for peripheral nerve block, spinal, and epidural
      analgesia and anesthesia. This formulation prolongs the duration of analgesia of bupivacaine
      for up to 72 hours with a single injection. The study was designed to compare two of our

      Patients with cystic fibrosis frequently develop chronic rhinosinusitis. Bacterial
      colonization is facilitated by a reduced mucociliary function and some previous studies
      suggest that the microbiology of the upper airways might influence the microbiology of the
      lower airway. The aim of this randomized control study is to demonstrate efficacy of
      antibiotic delivered by nebulized sonic aerosol therapy to decrease the bacterial load in
      sinuses and medium ostia and to improve the sino-nasal symptoms and endoscopic scores,
      quality of life and lung function
    ",Tobramycin Delivered by Nebulized Sonic Aerosol for Chronic Rhinosinusitis Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis Patients,"['Cystic Fibrosis', 'Rhinosinusitis', 'Lung Diseases']","['Sinusitis', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Lung Diseases', 'Fibrosis']","
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian
      population affecting ~1:3000 children, with a carrier frequency of 1:25. It is a multisystem
      disorder where pulmonary and sinonasal involvements occur in 90-100% of patients, and up to
      86% of children have nasal polyps . Patients with CF develop chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) due
      to the defect in the cystic fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) protein. The membrane
      lining the paranasal sinuses and the nose is identical to the membrane lining the lungs. As
      in lower airways (LAW) the defect CFTR protein result in viscous mucus . Consequently
      mucociliary function is reduced, which facilitates bacterial colonization and eventually
      infection leading to rhinosinusitis . In the past decades infection of the lower airways was
      the most prominent focus in treatment protocols for CF. Over the years infection of the upper
      airways (UAW) gradually gained more attention in CF.

      Previous research in the microbiology of the upper airways (UAW) in CF displayed that
      Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were most frequently
      cultures from the UAW . Since several studies showed concordance between organisms in the UAW
      and the LAW in CF, the hypothesis evolved that the UAW might influence the patient pulmonary
      status . Moreover, comparison of UAW and and LAW cultures in CF adult patients showed that
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be cultured from the UAW after eradication therapy which may
      suggest persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the UAW . This problem is highlighted in
      double lung transplant where UAW also appears as a protective niche of adapted clones of
      bacteria, which can intermittently spread this pathogen to the lung.

      CRS treatment in CF patients is based on daily nasal lavages but above all on local or
      systemic antibiotic treatments to eradicate bacteria in sinuses . Local therapy is favoured
      in CRS treatment of CF patients to avoid antibiotic side effects, changing organisms or
      resistance patterns. Sonic aerosol therapy with antibiotics for 15 days is commonly used for
      CRS in non CF patients to improve sinonasal symptoms and reduce purulent secretions as sound
      addition in pneumatic aerosol in head corpse's models creates an acoustic pressure at the
      ostia to improve the aerosol penetration in maxillary sinuses . However its efficacy on
      bacterial carrying in sinuses is not proved . At the opposite, efficacy of aerosol of
      tobramycin to LAW was proved in CF patients with a decrease of the density of Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, an improvement of FEV, and fewer pulmonary exacerbations .

      At the present time, efficacy of antibiotic (tobramycin) delivered by nebulized sonic aerosol
      for CRS treatment of CF patients is unknown particularly on bacterial carrying.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that nebulized sonic aerosol therapy with tobramycin
      in Cystic Fibrosis patients decreases significantly bacterial carrying in sinuses, sinus
      ostia of middle meatus and sputum compared to nebulized sonic aerosol therapy with placebo
      and that nebulized sonic aerosol therapy improves sino-nasal symptoms and endoscopic scores,
      quality of life and lung function.

      Migraine is a very common, neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent episodes of
      headache, potential progression to more frequent and severe attack patterns, and associated
      symptoms. In Spain, the prevalence rates are 12-13% and in women up to 17-18% Migraine has
      been shown to largely impair patient's Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), affecting
      work, household chores, social activities and family life. Recurrent headache attacks and
      frequently persistent fear and concern about the next attack disrupt the patient's familial,
      occupational and social life, and reduce his/her expectations for career and financial
      future. The consequences of this loss of productivity is also shared in his/her private life
      with their family. For this reason, not only the clinical benefit but other dimensions as
      HRQoL or work affectation should be added to the study of the benefits of migraine treatment.

      Migraine pathophysiology pathways may be shared with other illness, such as fibromyalgia,
      chronic fatigue or Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) . The purpose of the present clinical trial
      is to evaluate whether erenumab, at a target dose of 70 mg or 140 mg for a period of 12
      months, impacts Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) among patients withchronic migraine
      (CM) or High-Frequency Episodic Migraine (HFEM) who are affected with at least one
      comorbidity (fibromyalgia, fatigue and IBS). Data from this study, will provide additional
      information to help clinicians in treating patients with migraine and other illness.

           days according to weight. Run-in period includes 4 visits, called R1, R2, R3 and R4. The
           run-In period is to ensure that the treatment is well-tolerated, and that the exposure
           is in line with model-based predictions following repeated twice a day dosing with
           ticagrelor in this age group. At the end of the Run-in period (Visit R4), the patient

           medications and interventions that may be necessary for the patient's health and
           well-being during the study.

        -  Patients are to be followed until a common study end date (CSED) is reached defined as
           12 months after the last patient is randomized. Treatment duration is at least 12 months
           for study participants, and patients will continue on treatment until 12 months after
           last randomized patient or up to a maximum of 24 months. The expected average follow-up
           is 18 months, assuming a uniformly distributed enrolment period of 12 months.
           Considering inclusion of patients with at least 2 VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES in the past
           year, this treatment duration is considered long enough to evaluate effects on
           VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES events as well as to capture safety and tolerability data
           supporting a potential future long term use of ticagrelor.

        -  Due to ticagrelor mechanism of action and the potential to reduce symptoms caused by
           ischemia during a vaso-occlusion, a composite endpoint with painful crises and/or ACUTE
           CHEST SYNDROME has been selected for the primary endpoint. Painful crisis is the most
           common reason for emergency department visits for patients with SICKLE CELL DISEASE with
           a significant impact on young patients' lives, affecting them physically and
           emotionally. Secondary endpoints are included to broaden the understanding of effects in
           patients with SICKLE CELL DISEASE and to also assess potential benefits on symptomatic
           disease burden and health-related quality of life (HRQL).

        -  Patients will be treated with 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 mg twice a day or matching placebo,
           depending on body weight.

          1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent prior to any study specific procedures
             not part of standard medical care (local regulations and international guidelines are
             to be followed in determining the assent/consent requirements for children).

             VASO-OCCLUSIVE CRISES need to be documented in the patient's medical records or in
             other documents that can be reconciled.

          4. If aged 2 to ≤16 years, must have had a TCD within the past year prior to Visit 2. If

             which results in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year). If use of effective
             contraception cannot be secured in sexually active females, the patient cannot be
             included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of unsuitability which in the

             artery and the internal carotid artery should be considered. Any other criteria that
             would locally be considered as TCD indications for chronic transfusion would also
             exclude the patient.

          4. Pathological finding on any other imaging assay indicating increased risk for
             intracerebral bleeding or thromboembolism.

      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel, in
      improving coronary microvascular function, as measured by coronary flow reserve (CFR) in
      patients with T2DM at high risk of cardiovascular (CV) events undergoing elective PCI.
    ",Study in Diabetes Mellitus Patients Without Prior Myocardial Infarction or Stroke Undergoing Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,"['Diabetes Mellitus', 'Microvascular Coronary Artery Disease']","['Coronary Artery Disease', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Diabetes Mellitus']","
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) can be divided into macrovascular and microvascular disease,
      both different manifestations of atherosclerosis. Macrovascular CAD, i.e. obstructive CAD of
      epicardial coronary arteries have traditionally been the focus of CAD treatment.
      Microvascular circulation, on the other hand, consists of arterioles (diameter <100 μm)
      within myocardium and abnormalities in this arterial bed may also impair myocardial perfusion
      and result in ischaemia. An indication of microvascular disease can be achieved with coronary
      flow reserve (CFR) which is an integrated measure of flow through both large epicardial
      arteries and coronary microcirculation. CFR measurement is the ratio of resting coronary
      artery mean diastolic flow velocity in comparison to hyperaemic coronary artery mean
      diastolic flow velocity, where hyperaemia is often induced with pharmacologic agent such as
      adenosine infusion. CFR of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery during
      pharmacologic stress echocardiography has been found to provide effective prognostic
      information in patients with known or suspected CAD. This seems evident across patient
      populations, such as those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, or older age.
      Particularly, a CFR <2.0 has been associated with markedly increased cardiovascular (CV) risk
      in an unselected patient population.

      Ticagrelor primary mode of action is as a direct acting reversibly binding P2Y12 antagonist
      inhibiting ADP-induced platelet activation. However, ticagrelor has also been shown to
      increase extracellular adenosine concentration by inhibition of the equilibrative nucleoside
      transporter 1 (ENT1). Adenosine has been described to have a number of physiological effects
      including vasodilation, anti-inflammation, anti-platelet and cardioprotective effects and
      ticagrelor has been shown to enhance many of these adenosine-induced effects in animal models
      and in man. These adenosine-mediated effects may be beneficial to CAD patients and
      potentially impact coronary microvascular function and contribute to the clinical profile of
      ticagrelor. So far only one study has explored ticagrelor effect on coronary microvascular
      function. They showed, by using rubidium 82 positron emission tomography/computed tomography,
      that ticagrelor could improve local CFR compared to clopidogrel in CAD patients specifically
      in those regions that before treatment had impaired CFR (<2.5). CFR has been shown to be a
      strong independent predictor in diabetic patients with suspected coronary disease for future
      coronary events and survival.

      The ongoing THEMIS study is designed to test the hypothesis that ticagrelor is superior to
      placebo, in prevention of major CV events, as measured by time to first event of the
      composite of CV death, MI, or stroke in patients with T2DM at high risk of CV events.

      Patients undergoing elective PCI are excluded from the THEMIS study as these patients are
      treated with clopidogrel plus aspirin. The current study is designed to fill this data gap by
      generating clinically meaningful data with ticagrelor in THEMIS-like patients undergoing
      elective PCI.

      A new human coronavirus responsible for pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in China in December
      2019 and has spread rapidly. COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, has a very
      polymorphous clinical presentation, which ranges from upper respiratory tract infections to
      acute respiratory distress syndrome. It may appear serious straightaway or may evolve in two
      stages, with a worsening 7 to 10 days after the first clinical signs, potentially linked to a
      cytokine storm and accompanied by a high risk of thrombosis. The global mortality rate of
      COVID-19 is between 3% and 4%, with severe forms being more frequent among older patients.
      Management is symptomatic as no antiviral treatment has demonstrated any clinical benefit in
      this condition. Hydroxychloroquine is a derivative of chloroquine commonly used in some
      autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. It is active in vitro in cellular
      models of infection by many viruses such as HIV, hepatitis C or SARS-CoV. However, its
      interest in viral infections in humans has not been demonstrated.

      Very recently, a preliminary uncontrolled study evaluated the effect of hydroxychloroquine on
      viral shedding in subjects with COVID-19. Among 20 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine
      at a dose of 600 mg per day, the percentage of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the
      nasopharynx decreased from 100% at inclusion (start of treatment) to 43% six days later. In
      comparison, 15 of 16 untreated patients had a positive RT-PCR six days after inclusion.
      Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine has immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory properties, which
      could theoretically prevent or limit secondary worsening.

      The research hypothesis is that treatment with hydroxychloroquine improves prognosis and
      reduces the risk of death or use for invasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19.

      A severe outbreak of Chikungunya fever has been reported at La Réunion Island (France) in
      2005-2006. Chikungunya is a viral disease. Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus transmitted to
      humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes, usually of the genus Aedes (Aedes albopictus in La
      Réunion).

      To date, more than 266,000 cases were estimated to have occurred in the island (760,000
      inhabitants). Most of cases are expressed as a mild disease, with intense fever and
      arthralgias, with rare but serious complications (encephalitis, liver, cardiac or renal
      failures.) having required a hospitalization in an intensive care unit. 273 of such serious
      cases (immediately life threatening condition) have been reported among the cases, in
      patients aged over 10 days (59% were 65+ age old). Chikungunya was proven in 246 serious
      cases; 101 patients had comorbidities, and 27% of confirmed cases eventually died. In
      addition 44 cases of mother-to-child infections were reported and 40 were confirmed (one
      died).

      To date, in 248 death certificates, chikungunya was reported as the direct or indirect cause
      of death, with a median age of 79, range 0-102, and a sex-ratio (M/F) of 0.95. InVS, in
      collaboration with Inserm (French NIH) also reported (by June 6, 2006) a significant excess
      of mortality (from all causes) during the major outbreak which occurred from December, 2005
      (+10%) to April, 2006 (10.1%), with a peak of excess mortality reached in February (+34.4%),
      concommitant to the peak of incidence.

      Today, there is no antiviral treatment against Chikungunya. We showed from ex-vivo studies
      (in a sensitive model of cells culture to the viral infection) that chloroquine provides a
      significant inhibition on the replication of the Chikungunya virus. This efficacy seemed also
      to be reached at a plasmatic concentration of similar order of magnitude as recommended for
      treating malaria with this drug.

      This trial aims to assess efficacy and safety of chloroquine as as therapeutic treatment of
      chikungunya disease.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune
      cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells. It
      is not yet known whether chemotherapy alone is more effective than chemotherapy plus
      peripheral stem cell transplantation for ovarian epithelial cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of paclitaxel and
      carboplatin with that of carboplatin, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide followed by
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have persistent stage III or
      stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare progression-free and overall survival of patients with drug-sensitive,
      low-volume ovarian cancer that is persistent following standard therapy treated with salvage
      therapy comprising standard-dose paclitaxel and carboplatin vs high-dose carboplatin,
      mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide followed by bone marrow reconstitution. II. Compare the
      toxic effects of these two salvage regimens. III. Compare selected health-related aspects of
      quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating
      center and disease state at reassessment laparotomy. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and carboplatin
      IV continuously on days 1-5 every 3 weeks for a total of 6 courses. Arm II: Patients receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and mitoxantrone IV over 15 minutes on days -8, -6, and -4,
      and carboplatin IV continuously on days -8 through -4, followed by rescue with autologous
      bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Quality of life is assessed at baseline,
      at 3 and 9 weeks after starting treatment, and every 3 months for an additional 5 assessments

      The purpose of the study is to understand whether a new treatment of stroke - endovascular
      clot removal - can be added to the current standard of care to improve patient outcomes.

      All patients will receive the best standard stroke treatment. This includes treating patients
      with the clot dissolving drug tPA (tissue plasminogen activator). However, t-PA does not work
      in some patients and others are not eligible to receive t-PA because they present too late
      for treatment (they woke up with their stroke symptoms or their stroke was not witnessed).

      During endovascular revascularization the blockage in the artery is removed with the use of
      devices called stentreivers and or by giving clot dissolving drug at the site of the blockage
      in the artery to restore blood flow. Stentrievers are devices that have been designed by
      different companies to remove blood clots from arteries.

      Up to a maximum of 500 people at 20-25 hospitals across Canada and other countries will
      participate in this study.

      17alpha-monooxygenase TAK-700, when used with other hormone therapy, may lessen the amount of
      androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work
      in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      more than one drug and giving them after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is
      not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective than observation alone in
      treating patients who have undergone surgery for colon cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying irinotecan and fluorouracil with or
      without leucovorin to see how well they work compared to observation alone in treating
      patients who have undergone surgery for stage II colon cancer.
    ",Fluorouracil and Irinotecan With or Without Leucovorin Compared With Observation in Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery for Stage II Colon Cancer,Colorectal Cancer,Colonic Neoplasms,"
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare 5-year disease-free survival in patients with resected stage II adenocarcinoma
           of the colon treated with adjuvant chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil and irinotecan
           with or without leucovorin calcium vs no adjuvant therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare 8-year overall survival in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Correlate clinical, histological, and biological prognostic factors with outcome in
           patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, disease stage (pT3 vs pT4), pathological differentiation (poorly or
      undifferentiated vs well or moderately differentiated), and microsatellite instability
      (positive vs negative vs unknown). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients are further randomized to receive 1 of 3 adjuvant chemotherapy regimens.

             -  Regimen A: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes followed by leucovorin
                calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1,
                15, and 29. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
                disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Regimen B: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30-90 minutes followed by leucovorin
                calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1,
                8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Treatment repeats every 56 days for up to 4 courses in the
                absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Regimen C: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 60 minutes followed by fluorouracil
                IV continuously over 48 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Treatment repeats
                every 42 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation only. Patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,976 patients (988 per treatment arm [247 each in regimens A
      and B of arm I and 494 in regimen C of arm I]) will be accrued for this study within 4.5
      years.

      This study will assess the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of pathological gambling.
      Pathological gambling (PG) is a debilitating disorder, generally leading to severe personal,
      familial, financial, social, and occupational impairments. In PG, the patient experiences a
      progressive inability to resist impulses to gamble, and gambling significantly disrupt the
      patient's functioning in the personal, familial, and/or vocational spheres. Topiramate has
      shown preliminary evidence of efficacy in some impulse control disorders.

      The study's primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of retosiban to prolong
      pregnancy and improve neonatal outcomes compared with placebo. It is a Phase III, randomized,
      double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study and will be conducted in approximately 900
      females, aged 12 to 45 years, with an uncomplicated, singleton pregnancy and intact membranes
      in preterm labor between 24^0/7 and 33^6/7 weeks of gestation. Eligible maternal subjects
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either retosiban IV infusion or placebo
      IV infusion over 48 hours. If not previously administered, antenatal corticosteroid treatment
      should be administered as either (1) two 12-mg doses of betamethasone given intramuscularly
      24 hours apart or (2) four 6-mg doses of betamethasone administered intramuscularly every 12
      hours. A single rescue course of antenatal corticosteroids is permitted if the antecedent
      treatment was at least 7 days prior to study enrolment. Investigators have discretion to use
      a standardized regimen of magnesium sulphate, as well as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis
      for perinatal group B streptococcal infection. Prior to randomization, each subject will be
      stratified by progesterone treatment and gestational age. The progesterone strata will
      consist of subjects on established progesterone therapy or subjects not on established
      progesterone therapy at Screening. The study will comprise 6 phases: Screening, Inpatient
      Randomized Treatment, Post Infusion Assessment, Delivery, Maternal Post-Delivery Assessment,
      and Neonatal Medical Review. The duration of any subject's (maternal or neonatal)
      participation in the study will be variable and dependent on gestational ages (GA) at study
      entry and the date of delivery.

      To compare the response rate of single agent chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer given
      as standard treatment versus tailored treatment in a randomised phase III trial.
    ",Tailored Treatment in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,Colorectal Neoplasms,"
      The TS and MTHFR polymorphism has been investigated in a new study based on analysis of
      normal tissue. The results indicated that protein with a 3/3 TS polymorphism or a MTHFR T
      polymorphism had a significantly higher response rate and a longer time to progression than
      the other groups when treated with bolus 5-FU.

      Capecitabine is metabolised to 5-FU through a number of enzymatic steps. It is the first
      rationally designed drug that is based upon the high concentration of thymidine phosphorylase
      (TP) in many human tumors compared to normal tissue. TP is the last step in the conversion of
      capecitabine to 5-FU and seems to be the limiting factor for the activation. Capecitabine may
      to some extent mimic continues 5-FU infusion as opposed to bolus 5-FU. A number of small
      investigations have indicated that patients with 2R/2R TS polymorphism have a higher response
      rate than heterozygous patients.

      The TS and MTHFR polymorphism analysis can easily be performed on sputum, which means an easy
      collection and sending of the samples.

      At present single agent chemotherapy is based on three drugs (5-FU, capecitabine, and
      Irinotecan) with almost the same overall activity. It seems rational to investigate if
      improvement can be obtained by tailoring the treatment according to gene polymorphism.

      In normal wound healing, platelets activate macrophages to produce endogenous platelet
      derived growth factor (PDGF) and other growth factors which are responsible for would
      healing. In chronic wounds, macrophage activation is suppressed which leads to an
      inappropriate growth factor response causing failure of positive autocrine feedback loop
      which normally controls the healing process. The regular application of exogenous PRP and
      Thrombin, to chronic wounds, restores the autocrine feedback loop of tissue repair which
      appears to accelerate the normal cascade of tissue repair

      All applicants will be initially screened by phone and/or electronically to determine whether
      they potentially meet eligibility criteria. Those who appear to meet eligibility criteria and
      remain interested in the trial will be scheduled for an in-person interview.

      The in-person interview will be conducted by a psychologist or Masters' level staff member,
      who will obtain informed consent and evaluate subjects' behavioral eligibility (i.e.,
      willingness and appropriateness to participate) using structured and semi-structured clinical
      interviews including: an examination of the applicants' BED symptoms, their mood,
      suicidality, and other general psychopathology. Participants will also be asked to complete
      questionnaires assessing eating behavior, demographic characteristics, frequency of specific
      eating behaviors related to loss of control, risk of substance dependence with the
      consumption of high fat/sugar foods, alexithymia, night eating syndrome, sleep patterns and
      quality, and attitudes towards food cravings.

      Subjects who remain interested and pass this portion of the assessment will proceed to meet
      with the study physician or nurse practitioner, who will obtain a medical history and conduct
      a physical examination to determine medical eligibility. Subjects will also have an
      electrocardiogram (EKG), fasting blood test, and a urine pregnancy test (for females of child
      bearing age) to confirm eligibility.

      Upon successful completion of the screening visit, subjects will be asked to eat as they
      normally would for 2 weeks. Once per week over these two weeks they will receive a brief
      survey through REDcap to assess their binge eating episodes for eligibility.

      Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria assessed at the screening visit and during
      the run-in period will be scheduled for a randomization visit at the Center within 3 weeks of
      their screening.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to the two interventions in equal numbers (i.e., 1:1
      ratio). The subject's weight, blood pressure, and pulse will then be measured. Following
      randomization, all subjects will have a medical visit with the study physician or nurse
      practitioner who will instruct them in the use of liraglutide 3.0 (as described later) and
      provide the first month's supply of medication.

      After randomization, subjects will return at week 1 to assess rate of response. Subjects will
      return for study visits every two weeks thereafter, at weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17.

      These study visits include a brief medical visit (10-15 minutes) with a physician or nurse
      practitioner to monitor their response to the medication or any changes in health. Vitals and
      weight will be taken. Additionally, binge episodes, mood, suicidality, and symptom
      improvement will be assessed by the psychologist or Masters' level trained study staff.
      Participants will be asked also to complete questionnaires assessing quality of life,
      obsessions related to food, and food cravings prior to each treatment visit for the secondary
      outcomes:

      In summary, study visits will consist of the medical visit, completion of written surveys,
      review of structured interviews with the study staff and review of medication adverse events.
      These visits are expected to last about 30-40 minutes. The study assessments at week 17 will
      consist of the previously listed procedures and measures in addition to the questionnaires
      and blood tests conducted at baseline.

      Adhesion formation is a result of abdominal and pelvic surgery and is a cause of such
      diseases as chronic pain syndrome, bowel obstruction and infertility. Both patients and
      surgeons suffer when adhesions are encountered, since the surgery becomes more intense,
      lengthy, and complicated. Seprafilm® has been shown to limit the formation of adhesions in
      gynecologic and abdominal surgery. Limited data is available on the effectiveness of
      Seprafilm® in the prevention of abdominal wall and pelvic adhesions at the time of cesarean

      with difficult lysis of adhesions being the cause of morbidities such as bladder damage,
      increased blood loss, and longer operating times. The objective of this definitive project is
      to define the extent of reduction of adhesion formation of Seprafilm® when used at the time
      of primary cesarean section. Women undergoing primary cesarean section will be randomized for

      This study is intended to explore the possible protective role of anti-androgens in
      SARS-CoV-2 infection
    ",Proxalutamide Treatment for COVID-19 Female Outpatients,"['Covid19', 'SARS-CoV Infection']","['COVID-19', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome']","
      During the continuing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies have reported a
      significant difference in the rate of severe cases between adult females and adult males (42%
      vs 58%).Among children under the age of 14, the rate of severe cases was reported to be
      extremely low. To explain this difference, several theories have been proposed including
      cigarette smoking and lifestyle habits. However, no theory fits both the gender difference in
      severe cases as well as reduced risk in pre-pubescent children. Our past research on male
      androgenetic alopecia (AGA) has led us to investigate an association between androgens and
      COVID-19 pathogenesis. In normal subjects, androgen expression demonstrates significant
      variation between men and women as well as between adults and pre-pubescent children.

      SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects type II pneumocytes in the human lung. SARS-CoV-2 enters
      pneumocytes, by anchoring to the ACE2 cell surface receptor. Prior to receptor binding, viral
      spike proteins undergo proteolytic priming by the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
      TMPRSS2 inhibition or knock down reduces ability of SARS-CoV-1 (a related virus to
      SARS-CoV-2) to infect cells in vitro. Additionally, TMPRSS2 also facilitates entry of
      influenza A and influenza B into primary human airway cells and type II pneumocytes.

      The human TMPRSS2 gene has a 15 bp androgen response element and in humans, androgens are the
      only known transcription promoters for the TMPRSS2 gene. In a study of androgen-stimulated
      prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), TMPRSS2 mRNA expression increase was mediated by the androgen
      receptor. Further, the ACE2 receptor, also critical for SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity, is
      affected by male sex hormones with higher activity found in males.

      Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), often referred to as male pattern hair loss, is the most common
      form of hair loss among men. The development of androgenetic alopecia is androgen mediated
      and is dependent on genetic variants found in the androgen receptor gene located on the X
      chromosome; thus, it is hypothesized that men with AGA would be more prone to severe COVID-19
      disease. The investigators conducted a preliminary observational study of hospitalized
      COVID-19 patients at two Spanish tertiary hospitals between March 23-April 6, 2020 to test
      this theory. In total, 41 Caucasian males admitted to the hospitals with a diagnosis of
      bilateral SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 58 years (range
      23-79). Among them, 29 (71%) were diagnosed with AGA (16 (39%) were classified as severe AGA
      (Hamilton IV or above)) and 12 (29%) did not present clinical signs of AGA. The diagnosis of
      AGA was performed clinically by a dermatologist. The precise prevalence of AGA among
      otherwise healthy Spanish Caucasian males is unknown; however, based on published literature,
      the expected prevalence of a similar age-matched Caucasian population is approximately
      31-53%.

      Based on the scientific rationale combined with this preliminary observation, the
      investigators propose to test an anti-androgen as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed
      with COVID-19.

      We have chosen the use of the novel second generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist
      proxalutamide as a means for rapid reduction in AR activity. Proxalutamide (GT0918)
      demonstrates a dual mechanism of action. It is highly effective in inhibiting AR as well as
      exhibiting pharmacological effects of inducing the down-regulation of AR expression; the
      mechanism that is not present in bicalutamide and enzalutamide. Additionally, it has been
      reported that Proxalutamide lowers the expression of ACE2. Both would be beneficial for
      preventing SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung cells.

      This study is intended to explore the possible protective role of anti-androgens in
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Provided anti-androgens are effective in reducing the rate of COVID-19
      hospitalization, subjects enrolled in this study may experience a lower rate of
      hospitalization.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery when
      added to best medical therapy can reduce the subsequent risk of ipsilateral stroke in
      high-risk patients with recently symptomatic carotid occlusion and increased cerebral oxygen
      extraction fraction measured by positron emission tomography (PET).
    ",Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study,"['Stroke', 'Ischemic Attack, Transient', 'Cerebral Infarction']","['Cerebral Infarction', 'Ischemic Attack, Transient', 'Infarction']","
      The overall purpose of this research is to determine if a surgical operation called
      ""Extracranial-Intracranial Bypass"" can reduce the chance of a subsequent stroke in someone
      who has complete blockage in one main artery in the neck (the carotid artery) that supplies
      blood to the brain and has already suffered a small stroke. This surgery involves taking an
      artery from the scalp outside the skull, making a small hole in the skull and then connecting
      the scalp artery to a brain artery inside the skull. In this way the blockage of the carotid
      artery in the neck is bypassed and more blood can flow to the brain. In some people natural
      bypass arteries develop and the brain is already getting plenty of blood. These people have a
      low risk of stroke if they take medicine. In other people, no natural bypass arteries develop
      so less blood flows to their brains. This second group has a much higher risk of stroke while
      taking medicine, as high as 25-50% within the next two years. It is this second group of
      people who may benefit from having the bypass operation and who are the candidates for this
      study.

      This bypass surgery is considered experimental because it is not generally performed for this
      condition and it is unknown whether it leads to a decrease, an increase or no change in the
      risk of stroke. In order to determine if people fit into this second group of people who may
      benefit from the bypass operation they need to have a test called a PET scan. The PET scan
      measures the amount of blood that is getting to the brain and the amount of oxygen that the
      brain is using. The PET scan uses radioactive oxygen and water and is experimental (not
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration). If the PET scan shows that less
      blood is getting to the brain, there will be a 50-50 chance (like a coin toss) of receiving
      the bypass surgery or not. There will then be follow-up visits to the clinic one month later
      and then every three months for two years to check on the appropriate medical treatment that
      everyone will receive and to determine who has had a stroke.

      The study hypothesis is that extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery when added to best
      medical therapy can reduce by 40 percent subsequent stroke within two years in participants
      with recent TIA ('ministroke"") or stroke (</= 120 days) due to blockage of the carotid artery
      and reduced blood flow to the brain measured by PET.

      Standard liver retrieval procedures for transplantation from a deceased donor inevitably
      result in a ""reperfusion injury"" to the liver tissue. The purpose of this research study is
      to find out whether treatment of the liver with a ""preconditioning"" protocol before its
      removal from the donor will help reduce any of this injury.

      The ""preconditioning"" treatment being tested has two components. Firstly, a solution of
      glucose+insulin is infused and secondly, blood flow to the liver is stopped briefly (10
      minutes) and then resumed. Both strategies, individually, have been shown to reduce liver
      tissue injury in human studies.

      We hypothesize that combining both strategies will have a clinical benefit to patients and
      will improve liver function following transplant.
    ",The Effects of Glucose/Ischemic Preconditioning on Reperfusion Injury in Deceased-Donor Liver Transplantation,Liver Transplantation,Reperfusion Injury,"
      Liver transplantation is the only chance of cure for patients with end-stage liver disease.
      Unfortunately, standard organ preservation results in an ischemic-reperfusion injury (IRI) at
      the time of graft implantation. Novel strategies have been proposed to decrease reperfusion
      injury and improve graft function. This study will be the first to combine both strategies in
      a randomized, prospective trial. The intervention will occur during the retrieval surgery
      prior to cold preservation. Briefly, a glucose and insulin solution will be infused via the
      mesenteric vein at a controlled rate. Immediately prior to cross-clamping, blood supply to
      the liver will be restricted for 10 minutes and then resumed for 10 minutes before beginning
      cold preservation. All remaining surgical procedures, including the recipient surgery, will
      be performed by standard techniques. The liver recipient does not directly receive any
      intervention during this study.

      Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for a majority (approximately 85%) of lung cancer
      cases. Patients with localized disease can be cured through surgery, but only 20 % are
      operable.For the majority of patients with advanced disease, palliative cytotoxic
      chemotherapy remains the recommended therapy. Chemotherapy prolongs survival and improves
      quality of life.

      The recommended first-line therapy is 4-6 courses of a platinum in combination with a third
      generation compound (e.g. gemcitabine, vinorelbine, docetaxel, pemetrexed, paclitaxel). After
      first-line therapy, it has been recommended to observe the patients and offer second-line
      chemotherapy at disease progression.

      Regimens for second-line therapy include docetaxel or pemetrexed monotherapy. Pemetrexed is
      less toxic and superior to gemcitabine in non-squamous NSCLC, whereas docetaxel is the
      recommended second-line therapy in squamous cell carcinoma.

      The results of the studies of maintenance pemetrexed therapy are encouraging; the observed
      survival benefit is clinically relevant and relatively large considering the poor survival in
      patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, pemetrexed appears to be well tolerated. There
      are, however, several limitations to the studies that have been conducted: Relatively few
      elderly patients and no PS 2 patients were enrolled - and not all patients on the
      control-arms received pemetrexed at progression.

      The overall aim of this study is to investigate whether immediate maintenance pemetrexed
      therapy prolongs survival compared to observation and pemetrexed therapy at progression in
      patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, it will be explored whether patients with
      'performance status' 2 and elderly ≥ 70 years tolerate and benefit from maintenance therapy;
      and what characteristics and blood biomarkers are associated with sensitivity and
      tolerability of such therapy.
    ",Pemetrexed in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: at Progression vs Maintenance Therapy After Induction Chemotherapy,"Carcinoma, Non-small-cell Lung","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung","
      In previous studies without maintenance therapy, median overall survival (OS) for performance
      status (PS) 0-1 patients has been approximately 9 months, corresponding to 6 months from
      randomization in this study. We consider an improvement in overall survival of two months to
      be the minimum difference that will lead to routine use of maintenance pemetrexed in Norway.
      To demonstrate an improvement in median overall survival from 6 to 8 months with an α =0.05
      and β =0.20, 198 evaluable patients are required on each arm. We expect a drop-out rate of
      maximum 10 %, and therefore intend to randomize a total of 436 patients (PS 0-1) - of which
      we expect 150 to be 70 years or older.

      Sample size is calculated on PS 0-1 patients only. In addition, PS 2 patients will be
      randomized until the required number of PS 0-1 patients have been accrued. We estimate that a
      total of 100 PS 2 patients will be enrolled - sufficient for hypothesis-generating analyses
      of the benefit of maintenance therapy in elderly and PS 2 patients.

      Based on experience from our previous studies we estimate that approximately 30% of patients
      will not complete or progress during induction chemotherapy; or be ineligible due
      deterioration of PS. Consequently, we need to include approximately 765 patients.

      This study looks at the safety and effectiveness of PF-07304814 in treating COVID-19 in
      people who have been hospitalized with the infection. Participants in the study will be
      treated with either PF-07304814 plus current standard of care (SOC), or with placebo plus
      current SOC. This is ACTIV-3/TICO Treatment Trial H6.
    ",PF-07304814 for Inpatients With COVID-19 (An ACTIV-3/TICO Treatment Trial),COVID-19,COVID-19,"
      This is a treatment trial of the ACTIV-3/TICO master protocol (NCT04501978) to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of PF-07304814 in hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19.

      This is a randomized, blinded, controlled sub-study of PF-07304814 plus current SOC against
      placebo plus current SOC. The placebo arm may be shared across other sub-studies of the
      ACTIV-3/TICO master protocol. When more than one drug is being tested at the same time,
      participants will be randomly allocated to treatments or placebo.

      Randomization will be stratified by study site pharmacy and disease severity. There are 2
      disease severity strata: participants without organ failure (severity stratum 1) and
      participants with organ failure (severity stratum 2).

      An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly review interim analyses
      and summarize safety and efficacy outcomes. The pace of enrollment with be initially
      restricted, and there will be an early review of safety data by the DSMB. At the outset of
      the trial, only participants in disease severity stratum 1 will be enrolled. This will
      continue until approximately 300 participants are enrolled and followed for 5 days. The exact
      number will vary according to the speed of enrollment and the timing of DSMB meetings. Prior
      to expanding enrollment to also include patients in disease severity stratum 2, safety will
      be evaluated and a pre-specified futility assessment by the DSMB will be carried out using 2
      ordinal outcomes assessed at Day 5.

      If PF-07304814 passes the futility assessment, enrollment of participants will be expanded,
      seamlessly and without any data unblinding, to include participants in disease severity
      stratum 2 as well as those in disease severity stratum 1. Future interim analyses will be
      based on the primary endpoint of sustained recovery and will use pre-specified guidelines to
      determine early evidence of benefit, harm, or futility for the investigational agent.
      Participants will be followed for 18 months following randomization.

      This trial will be conducted in several hundred clinical sites. Participating sites are
      affiliated with networks funded by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and
      the US Department of Veterans Affairs.

      Background: Alteplase is the only approved acute drug treatment in ischemic stroke and aims
      at dissolving arterial clots causing cerebral ischemia. The overall benefit of alteplase is
      substantial. However, there is considerable room for improvement as 2/3 of patients with
      large clots may not achieve reopening of the vessel and up to 40% of the patients remain
      severely disabled or die.

      Tenecteplase, a modified tissue plasminogen activator, has been shown to be a more efficient
      and safer thrombolytic drug than alteplase in pre-clinical studies. Tenecteplase has replaced
      alteplase as thrombolytic treatment in myocardial infarction and may also be the drug of
      choice in ischemic stroke.

      Tenecteplase and alteplase had a similar safety profile in the NOR-TEST trial and there were
      no differences in efficacy between the two treatment groups. However, a majority of patients
      had mild stroke which may be associated with a natural favorable prognosis.

      In spite of these neutral results, tenecteplase has the potential to replace alteplase as the
      drug of choice, based on a better pharmacological profile and a simpler practical
      administration. There is, however, need for a higher number of patients to prove the efficacy
      and safety of tenecteplase.

      Hypothesis: Tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg is non-inferior compared with alteplase 0.9 mg/kg.

      Objectives: To compare efficacy and safety of tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg (single bolus) vs.

      onset; b) within 4½ hours after awakening with stroke symptoms, and c) as bridging therapy
      within 4½ hours before thrombectomy.

      Study design: NOR-TEST-2 is a multi-centre PROBE (prospective randomised, open-label, blinded
      endpoint) trial, designed to establish non-inferiority of tenecteplase as compared with
      alteplase for consecutively admitted patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated within 4½
      hours after symptom onset. Randomisation tenecteplase:alteplase is 1:1.

      This randomized phase III trial is studying giving irinotecan and cetuximab together with
      bevacizumab to see how well it works compared with giving irinotecan and cetuximab alone in
      treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that progressed during first-line
      therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether
      irinotecan and cetuximab are more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to Zubrod
      performance status (0 vs 1 or 2), discontinuation of oxaliplatin during first-line therapy
      (yes vs no), planned concurrent chemotherapy (FOLFIRI vs single-agent irinotecan
      hydrochloride), and time from last dose of bevacizumab (14-42 days vs >= 43 days).

      All patients receive 1 of the following chemotherapy regimens:

      SINGLE AGENT IRINOTECAN HYDROCHLORIDE: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      FOLFIRI: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes and leucovorin calcium
      IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours on days 1 and 2.
      Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride or FOLFIRI as outlined above
      and cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 14-21 days (depending upon
      chemotherapy regimen) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride or FOLFIRI as outlined above
      and cetuximab as in arm I. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 14-21 days (depending upon chemotherapy regimen) in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III (closed to accrual as of 4/20/2009): Patients receive single-agent irinotecan
      hydrochloride or FOLFIRI as outlined above and cetuximab as in arm I. Patients also receive a
      higher dose of bevacizumab (higher than in arm II) IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 14-21 days (depending upon chemotherapy regimen) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

          1. Have a diagnosis of primary progressive, secondary progressive, or progressive
             relapsing MS (as defined by Lublin and Reingold, 1996). These conditions require the
             presence of continuous clinical disease worsening over a period of at least 3 months.
             Patients with these conditions may also have superimposed relapses, but are
             distinguished from relapsing-remitting patients by the lack of clinically stable
             periods or clinical improvement.

          2. Have known intolerance, contraindication to, or history of non-compliance with, the
             use of glatiramer acetate or interferon beta-1a.

          4. The patient is considered by the Investigator to be immunocompromised based on medical
             history, physical examination, laboratory testing, or due to prior immunosuppressive
             or immunomodulating treatment.

          5. Subjects for whom MRI is contraindicated, i.e., have pacemakers or other
             contraindicated implanted metal devices, have suffered or are at risk for side effects

             neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, renal, or other major disease that would
             preclude participation in a clinical trial.

          7. History of malignant disease, including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies
             (with the exception of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have

      RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. It is not yet known
      whether treatment with interferon alfa is more effective than observation alone for stage II
      or stage III melanoma that has been completely removed surgically.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying high dose interferon alfa to see how
      well it works compared to observation only in treating patients with stage II or stage III
      melanoma that has been completely removed by surgery.
    ",High-Dose Interferon Alfa in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Melanoma,Melanoma (Skin),Melanoma,"
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective:

        -  Compare the effect of high-dose interferon alfa-2b treatment on the relapse-free
           survival of patients with stage II or III resected malignant melanoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Compare the effect of this treatment regimen on overall survival of these patients.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Compare the effect of treatment on quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by pathologic lymph node status
      (known vs unknown),lymph node staging procedures(sentinel lymph node procedure vs. elective
      lymph node dissection vs. no lymphadenectomy), Breslow depth (<= 1.0 mm vs. 1.01-2.0 mm vs.
      2.01-4.0 mm vs > 4.0 mm), ulceration of the primary lesion (yes vs. no vs. unknown), and
      disease stage (lymph node positive [N1, N2a] vs. lymph node negative [N0]). Patients are
      randomized into one of two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio.

        -  Arm I (observation): Patients undergo observation for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II (Interferon Alfa-2b): Patients receive high-dose interferon alfa-2b intravenously
           (IV) over 20 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days. Treatment repeats weekly for 4 weeks
           in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed before treatment, at day 22, every 3 months for 2 years, and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter until 15 years after randomization.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,420 patients will be accrued for this study over 5 years.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of retosiban to prolong
      pregnancy in females with spontaneous preterm labor compared with atosiban. This objective is
      based on the hypothesis that prolonging the time to delivery in the absence of harm may
      benefit the newborn, particularly in women who experience spontaneous preterm labor at early
      gestational ages (GA). This study is designed to test this hypothesis through a direct
      comparison with atosiban, a mixed oxytocin vasopressin antagonist indicated for short-term
      use to delay imminent preterm birth in women between 24^0/7 and 33^6/7 weeks' gestation in
      preterm labor. This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study, which consists of 6
      phases: Screening, Inpatient Randomized Treatment, Post Infusion Assessment, Delivery,
      Maternal Post Delivery Assessment, and Neonatal Medical Review. Approximately 330 females
      will be randomly assigned to retosiban or atosiban treatment in a 1:1 ratio. The duration of
      any one subject's (maternal or neonatal) participation in the study will be variable and
      dependent on GA at study entry and the date of delivery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent is required prior to a subject's
             participation in the study and the performance of any protocol specific procedures.
             Adolescents aged 12 to 17 years must provide written agreement to participate in the
             study in accordance with applicable regulatory and country or state requirements.
             Subjects will also be asked to sign a release for medical records at the time of
             consenting to allow access to both the maternal and neonatal records including
             information about delivery and infant care as well as information collected prior to
             the consent having been signed.

          -  Females aged 12 to 45 years, with an uncomplicated, singleton pregnancy and intact
             membranes in preterm labor (Note: This protocol includes pregnant adolescents, aged 12
             to 17 years, as appropriate, based on national or local regulations.).

          -  Gestational age between 24^0/7 and 33^6/7 weeks as determined by known fertilization
             date, either in vitro fertilization or intrauterine insemination, last menstrual
             period confirmed by the earliest ultrasound prior to 24^0/7 weeks' gestation, or the
             earliest ultrasound alone prior to 24^0/7 weeks' gestation, whichever is the most
             accurate method available for each subject. In situations where prenatal ultrasound
             records are not available at the time the subject presents, the investigator will make
             every effort to obtain these records (either via computer records, directly from the
             subject's primary care obstetrician, or via telephone). However, in cases in which
             these records are not readily available (e.g., off hours, holiday), it is within the
             investigator's discretion to use GA based on a verbal history from the subject with
             the intent of getting confirmation from the medical records as soon as possible.

          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with preterm labor according to both of the following
             criteria:

        Regular uterine contractions at a rate of >=4 contractions of at least 30 seconds duration
        during a 30-minute interval confirmed by tocodynamometry

        AND at least 1 of the following:

        Cervical dilation >=2 centimeter (cm) and <=4 cm by digital cervical examination or If <2
        cm dilation by digital cervical examination, a cervical change consisting of an increase of
        at least 25% effacement or 1 cm dilation

             than atosiban (e.g., transfers from other care units) during their current episode of
             preterm labor may be eligible for the study. Historical failure of a tocolytic
             treatment in a previous episode of preterm labor is not a required inclusion
             criterion. Tocolytic failure is defined by progressive cervical changes or continuing
             uterine contractions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             pregnancy outcome (e.g., alcohol abuse or opioid addiction).

          -  Women with any diagnosis, condition, treatment, or other factor that in the opinion of
             the investigator has the potential to affect or confound assessments of efficacy or
             safety.

          -  Women with documented active hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infection, unstable
             liver disease (as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy,
             hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or persistent jaundice), cirrhosis,
             known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic
             gallstones).

          -  History of sensitivity to the IPs or components thereof or a history of drug or other
             allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)/PPD medical
             monitor, contraindicates their participation.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, thiotepa, and etoposide, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher
      doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. Isotretinoin may be effective in
      preventing recurrence of glioma. It is not yet known which regimen of chemotherapy plus
      autologous stem cell transplantation with or without isotretinoin is more effective in
      treating recurrent high-grade glioma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying high-dose chemotherapy or
      intermediate-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation to see how
      well it works compared to high-dose chemotherapy or intermediate-dose chemotherapy followed
      by autologous stem cell transplantation and isotretinoin in treating young patients with
      recurrent high-grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the event-free survival and overall survival of pediatric patients with
           recurrent high-grade gliomas treated with a single course of high-dose carboplatin,
           etoposide, and thiotepa and autologous stem cell transplantation vs multiple courses of
           intermediate-dose carboplatin and thiotepa and autologous stem cell transplantation with
           or without isotretinoin.

        -  Compare the number of hospital days and time to engraftment in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic death rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the tolerability of isotretinoin in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      pathologic diagnosis (glioblastoma multiforme vs anaplastic astrocytoma vs other high-grade
      glioma).

        -  Chemotherapy and autologous stem cell reinfusion (ASCR): Patients are randomized to 1 of
           2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I (high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR): Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy
                comprising carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days -8 to -6; thiotepa IV over 3 hours
                and etoposide IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -3; and filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or
                subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts
                recover. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or bone marrow are reinfused
                on day 0.

             -  Arm II (intermediate-dose chemotherapy and ASCR): Patients receive
                intermediate-dose chemotherapy comprising carboplatin IV over 4 hours and thiotepa
                IV over 3 hours on days 1-2 and G-CSF IV or SC once daily beginning on day 4 and
                continuing until blood counts recover. Autologous PBSC or bone marrow are reinfused
                on day 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 3 courses.

        -  Maintenance therapy: After recovery from chemotherapy (approximately day 30
           post-transplantation), all patients are further randomized to 1 of 2 maintenance arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive oral isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment
                repeats every 28 days for a total of 6 courses.

             -  Arm II: Patients do not receive maintenance therapy. In all arms, treatment
                continues in the absence of disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80-150 patients (40-75 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 5 years.

      This study is to see if a new nicotine replacement therapy safely helps people to quit
      smoking if it is used the way it would be if it were sold at the pharmacy and used at home.
      Approximately 1500 subjects will be enrolled into the study. The study will require
      participants to use the treatment for 12 weeks and there will be a 14-week follow-up period.
      The study will be conducted in approximately 20 pharmacies across the United States.

      At the first visit to the pharmacy, participants will be asked some questions to see if they
      are eligible to participate. Participants will be asked to sign a consent form if they agree
      to participate. Participants will answer some more questions, and blow into a machine to
      measure their carbon monoxide (CO) levels to make sure they qualify for the trial.
      Participants will be asked to go to a nearby dentist who will look at their mouths.
      Participants will go back to the pharmacy and if they qualify, they will be given a supply of
      their assigned treatment. They will have an equal chance of receiving a treatment that has a
      drug in it or one that has no drug in it. They will be given a diary to keep track of how
      much of the treatment they use.

      Subjects will go to the pharmacy four more times to hand in their diaries and blow into a
      machine that will measure their CO levels. At the last visit, subjects will have their mouths
      examined by a dentist again to have their mouth checked.

      Subjects will receive four telephone calls during the study where they will be asked some
      questions.

      After the 12 week treatment period, subjects will receive two to three more telephone calls,

    ",Study to Determine if a New Nicotine Replacement Therapy Can Safely Help Smokers to Quit Smoking,Tobacco Dependence,Tobacco Use Disorder,"
      This trial is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled parallel group
      study to measure the efficacy and safety of a new nicotine replacement therapy for smoking
      cessation in a naturalistic environment. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (active
      to placebo). It is anticipated that data from about 450 in the active treatment group at Week
      12 will be required for the safety analysis. In order to obtain that number of subjects,
      approximately 1500 subjects will need to be enrolled into the Use phase of the study, 1000 in
      the active arm and 500 in the placebo arm.

      Based on the directions for use on the Drug Facts label, the study will include six weeks of
      full study drug treatment and then six weeks of progressive tapering drug treatment (Weeks
      1-12). There will be a 14-week post-use follow up period.

      This trial will be conducted in three sequential phases: Enrollment (baseline), Use and
      Post-use Follow-up. The Enrollment Phase will be conducted in approximately 20 pharmacies in
      nine diverse geographical areas in the continental United States. Subjects who qualify to
      participate in the study will be given three units of investigational product, a subject
      diary for tracking investigational product use and a medical problems worksheet to assist in
      the collection of AE information. Subjects will also be given a small hand counter and will
      be encouraged to use it to help keep track of the number of doses they use each day. Subjects
      will also be given a card with contact information for the pharmacy and study nurses. Where
      needed, the subject can also speak with the study physician.

      During the Use Phase, the collection of data related to efficacy will be accomplished during
      four return visits to the pharmacy (at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 12). Self-reported abstinence will
      be verified by carbon monoxide (CO) measurements obtained at each pharmacy visit. Subjects
      will be given a subject use diary at each follow-up and re-supply visit and completed diaries
      will be collected each time the subject returns to the pharmacy. Subjects can return to the
      pharmacy for additional supplies at any time during their participation. Empty units will be
      returned during these visits.

      Safety data will be collected during four telephone interviews, conducted by trained nurse
      interviewers, at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 12. If a subject reports an adverse event during a visit
      (return visit or resupply visit), this information will be immediately forwarded to the nurse
      interviewers for follow-up. Subjects may also initiate a call to the study nurses themselves
      to discuss health problems. All AE information collected will be reviewed by a physician as
      the adverse events are collected. A standardized visual mouth examination will be conducted
      by trained dentists at the enrollment visit and at the Week 12 return visit.

      During the Post-use Follow-up period, self-reported efficacy and safety data will be
      collected during two telephone interviews initiated by trained nurse interviewers (at weeks
      16 and 26). Subjects reporting abstinence since the last visit or abstinence for the prior
      seven days during these two interviews will be asked to return to the pharmacy to verify
      abstinence with an exhaled CO measurement. An additional telephone interview will be
      conducted between Week-12 and Week-16, by trained nurse interviewers, who will administer the
      End of Treatment questions to those subjects who have reported the following product use
      behavior that are inconsistent with the directions on the Drug Facts label: Use of more than
      64 doses in a 24-hour period at least one time or use of more than 4 doses per hour at least
      one time based on the diary or their self report.

      To compare the efficacy of a novel endoscopic clipping device(Resolution Clip™) and
      conventional epinephrine injection and heater probe thermocoagulation in control of peptic
      ulcer bleeding and prevention of recurrent bleeding
    ",Resolution Endoclips Vs Epinephrine Injection and Heater Probe,Peptic Ulcer Hemorrhage,"['Peptic Ulcer', 'Peptic Ulcer Hemorrhage', 'Ulcer', 'Hemorrhage']","
      The mortality of peptic ulcer bleeding remains high despite advances in endoscopy and medical
      therapy. Endoscopic therapy effectively controls peptic ulcer bleeding and substantially
      reduces recurrent bleeding. However, the best endoscopic therapy is still unclear. The
      current standard of therapy is injection with diluted epinephrine and heater probe (3.2mm)
      thermo-coagulation. However, it may be associated with complications such as precipitation of
      myocardial ischemia or heater probe perforation.

      Endoscopic clipping is an emerging modality of endoscopic treatment, it mimics the use of
      surgical ligature on bleeding artery. Endo-clipping has the theoretical advantage over
      injection and heater probe in that the tissue reaction or damage will be much milder.

      Resolution Clip™ is a newly developed endo-clipping device. It is superior to older
      generations of endo-clips in that it allows repeated closures and re-opening of clip so as to
      facilitate accurate deployment onto bleeding artery to ensure its optimal placement for

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer
      cells. Bone marrow transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy
      drugs and kill more cancer cells.

      therapy plus bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have aggressive
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

           with high-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy plus autologous bone marrow
           transplantation.

        -  Determine the efficacy and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to risk group (good vs intermediate vs poor).

      Patients undergo harvest of autologous bone marrow stem cells after priming chemotherapy and
      before transplantation.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising the CHOP or VAPEC-B regimen. The CHOP
      regimen consists of vincristine (VCR) IV, cyclophosphamide (CTX) IV, and doxorubicin (DOX) IV
      on day 1 and oral prednisolone (PRDL) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for six
      courses. The VAPEC-B regimen consists of DOX IV on days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71; CTX IV on
      days 1, 29, and 57; VCR IV on days 8, 22, 36, 50, and 64; bleomycin IV on days 8, 36, 64;
      oral etoposide (VP-16) on days 15-19, 43-47, and 71-75; and oral PRDL daily for 13 weeks.

      Patients then may undergo radiotherapy for 2-3 weeks to areas of original bulk or residual
      disease.

        -  Good-risk group: Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive no further treatment.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive melphalan (L-PAM) before or after total body irradiation
                (TBI), which is delivered in 3 fractions over 24 hours. After completion of
                radiotherapy, patients undergo autologous bone marrow transplantation (AuBMT).

        -  Intermediate- or poor-risk group: Patients are randomized one of three treatment arms.

             -  Arm III: Patients receive L-PAM IV on day -2 and AuBMT on day 0.

             -  Arm IV: Patients receive treatment as in arm II.

             -  Arm V: Patients receive carmustine IV on day -6, VP-16 IV once daily and cytarabine
                IV twice daily on days -5 to -2, and L-PAM IV on day -1. Radiotherapy to bulk
                disease begins after completion of chemotherapy. Patients undergo AuBMT on day 0.

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 2
      years, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC) is the fifth most common cancer
      worldwide. Surgery to remove the tumour remains the principal form of treatment for liver
      cancer, however recurrence of the disease after surgery is common and survival after
      recurrence is poor. At the moment there is no recommended standard treatment for HCC
      immediately after the tumour has been removed surgically. PI-88 is a new experimental drug
      which blocks the growth of new blood vessels in tumours to stop the tumour growing (starves
      it of food) and also stops tumour cells spreading. Previous experience with PI-88 has shown
      it has been well tolerated and has shown some benefit in delaying the time it takes for the
      hepatocellular carcinoma to reappear after surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and capecitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor
      cells. It is not yet known which regimen of chemotherapy with or without erlotinib and/or
      radiation therapy is most effective in treating pancreatic cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving gemcitabine together with or
      without capecitabine and/or radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with giving
      gemcitabine together with or without erlotinib in treating patients with locally advanced
      pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess whether administrating chemoradiotherapy in patients whose tumor is controlled
           after 4 months of induction chemotherapy (CT) increases survival compared with
           continuation of the same CT in patients with unresectable, locally advanced
           adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

      Secondary

        -  To assess whether erlotinib hydrochloride combined with gemcitabine hydrochloride and
           administered as maintenance treatment increases progression-free survival compared with
           gemcitabine hydrochloride alone and without maintenance treatment.

        -  To evaluate the response rate in the CT and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) arms.

        -  To evaluate tolerance to erlotinib hydrochloride as maintenance treatment after the end
           of CT or CRT.

        -  To study the predictive molecular factors (i.e., survivin, K-ras, EGFR, PTEN, or AKT) of
           survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients in the first randomization are stratified
      according to center and ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients in the second
      randomization are stratified according to center and initial treatment arm (I vs II).

        -  First randomization: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
                15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. Following the first evaluation, patients continue to
                receive gemcitabine hydrochloride on days 57, 64, 71, 85, 92, and 99 for a total of
                4 months.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
                15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. Following the first evaluation, patients continue to
                receive gemcitabine hydrochloride on days 57, 64, 71, 85, 92, and 99. Patients also
                receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily for 4 months.

      After completion of treatment in the first randomization proceed to the second randomization.

        -  Second randomization: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients continue gemcitabine hydrochloride as in arm I in the first
                randomization on days 113, 120, and 127 and on days 141, 148, and 155 for 2 months
                in the absence of disease progression.

             -  Arm II: Patients continue gemcitabine hydrochloride as in arm II in the first
                randomization on days 113, 120, and 127 and on days 141, 148, and 155 and oral
                erlotinib hydrochloride daily for 2 months followed by erlotinib hydrochloride
                alone as maintenance therapy in the absence of disease progression.

             -  Arm III: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo radiotherapy
                beginning on day 127, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks, in the absence of disease
                progression.

             -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo radiotherapy
                beginning on day 127, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Beginning 15 days after
                completion of CRT, patients receive a reintroduction of oral erlotinib
                hydrochloride alone once daily in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue will be analyzed for the relationship between biological markers and resistance
      to treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.

      In this study, researchers will learn more about a study drug called BIIB122 in participants
      with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD). The study will focus on participants with a
      specific genetic variant in their LRRK2 gene.

      The main question researchers are trying to answer is if taking BIIB122 slows the worsening
      of PD more than placebo in the early stages of PD.

      To help answer this question, researchers will use a questionnaire called the Movement
      Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, also known as the MDS-UPDRS.

        -  The MDS-UPDRS measures impairment and disability in people living with PD. It was
           created in the 1980s and is one of the most used rating scales for PD symptoms.

        -  The MDS-UPDRS has 4 parts, and a higher score means more severe PD symptoms.

        -  Part I assesses non-motor experiences of daily living, including but not limited to
           memory loss, problems sleeping, pain, depression, and anxiety.

        -  Part II measures motor experiences of daily living.

        -  Part III is the results of a motor symptoms exam by a medical professional.

        -  Part IV records PD complications caused by motor symptoms.

      Researchers will also learn more about the safety of BIIB122.

      A description of how the study will be done is given below.

        -  Participants will take BIIB122 or a placebo as tablets by mouth. A placebo looks like
           the study drug but contains no real medicine.

        -  Participants will be in the study for 103 weeks to 187 weeks. This includes the
           screening and follow-up periods.

        -  Participants will take BIIB122 or placebo 1 time a day for 96 to 180 weeks.

        -  Participants can continue to take certain medications for PD. Participants must be on
           the same dose of medication for at least 90 days before the study begins.

        -  Participants will visit the clinic less often as the study continues, ranging every 4
           weeks to every 24 weeks.

      Udenafil (Zydena), a newly developed PDE-5 inhibitor, has been proved to have similar
      efficacy and safety profile, compared with other PDE-5 inhibitors. Also, laboratory data
      showed that udenafil inhibits ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in rat heart failure

      symptom, exercise capacity and hemodynamic status in patients with systolic heart failure. In
      this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with systolic
      heart failure will be enrolled according to the eligibility criteria. After randomization,
      study participants will be assigned to receive either 50mg of udenafil or placebo two times a

      In the management of non-CF bronchiectasis, bronchodilator treatment (LABA)and use of inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS) is still a matter of debate. Previous studies have claimed beneficial
      effects of ICS (with or without bronchodilator), such as improvement of the HRQL, a reduction
      in daily sputum volume and/or exacerbation frequency. However, in all previous studies there
      was no clear exclusion of patients with asthma or COPD, or no use of placebo. The current
      study will be the first study evaluating the effect of ICS/LABA treatment in non-CF
      bronchiectasis excluding patients with asthma and COPD.

      This is a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing
      Formoterol-beclomethasone 12/200 mcg BID versus placebo to evaluate the reduction in cough
      measured by the Leicester cough questionnaire. Secondary objectives are the improvement of
      health-related quality of life and symptoms, reduction in sputum production, pulmonary
      function (FEV1) and the frequency of exacerbation. Furthemore, we will assess the
      inflammatory response in serum and sputum.

      After a wash-out period of 1 month, eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment with
      formoterol-beclomethasone or matching placebo. All subjects will be treated with the regimen
      of medication for 3 months. An end-of-study (EOS) visit will be performed after completion of

      The epidermal barrier efficacy is determined by the physicochemical properties of the
      epidermal lipid matrix, among which ω-6 essential fatty acids (EFAs) play a key role.
      Inversely, the ω-3 EFAs are not found in the epidermis. For patients receiving
      lipid-containing parenteral nutrition (LCPN), the improvement of the epidermal barrier
      through the infusion of most appropriate intravenous fat emulsions (IVFE) could have many
      applications in clinical nutrition, mainly limiting water loss in patients receiving
      long-term LCPN and help in electrolyte and water balance.

      The objective of this interventional clinical trial is to evaluate the epidermal barrier
      function in patients receiving long-term LCPN comparing two compositions of IVFE: (i) soybean
      oil (SO)-based IVFE (Medialipide) or (ii) fish oil (FO)-containing IVFE (Lipidem). Epidermal
      barrier function will be assessed through the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement on
      the skin surface, a validated marker of the epidermal barrier efficacy. The two IVFE
      (SO-based or FO-containing) will be compared using a randomized double blind crossover
      design, using patients as their own control. Each IVFE will be allocated for a 3-month
      period, allowing sufficient timeframe for epidermal complete renewal. Patient's epidermal and
      red blood cell EFA profile will be determinate in order to facilitate result interpretation.

      This phase III trial compares an additional support program (text message reminders and/or
      telephone-based counseling) with usual care in making sure breast cancer patients take their
      endocrine therapy medication as prescribed (medication adherence). Medication adherence is
      how well patients take the medication as prescribed by their doctors, and good medical
      adherence is when patients take medications correctly. Poor medication adherence has been
      shown to be a serious barrier to effective treatment for hormone receptor positive breast
      cancer patients. Adding text message reminders and/or telephone-based counseling to usual
      care may increase the number of days that patients take their endocrine therapy medication as
      prescribed.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I (TMR): Patients receive online educational information about ET at the start of their
      ET medication. Patients also receive daily text message reminders to take their ET medication
      and monthly text messages about how they are doing with taking their ET medication. These
      text messages continue for 9 months.

      ARM II (MI): Patients receive online educational information about ET at the start of their
      ET medication. Patients also receive a total of 5 motivational interviewing counseling
      sessions via telephone over 30-90 minutes for up to 9 months. These sessions are designed to
      support patients while they take their ET medication, develop health goals, and stay on track
      in achieving those goals.

      ARM III (TMR + MI): Patients receive online educational information about ET at the start of
      their ET medication. Patients also receive text messages as in Arm I and motivational
      interviewing counseling sessions as in Arm II.

      ARM IV (ENHANCED USUAL CARE): Patients attend usual care clinic visits every 3-6 months and
      receive online educational information about ET at the start of their ET medication. Patients
      also receive optional online information about living a healthy life after breast cancer.

      After completion of study participation, patients are followed up for up to 24 months.

      Purpose/Goal: To investigate how long course radiation therapy (RT), both with or without

      Research indicates that patients undergoing curative RT for various cancers experience
      adverse immune effects, as indicated by reduced biomarker levels and activity. RT has been
      observed to cause a striking reduction in total lymphocyte count, affecting mainly the
      T-cells. Furthermore, the reduction in the lymphocyte count after RT has been correlated with
      poorer outcome for bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, uterine cancer, and brain
      metastases.

      Research into the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been conducted to
      determine the utility of these treatments in addressing the unmet needs of many patients with
      cancer. There is preliminary evidence that acupuncture, in particular, is successful at
      improving many cancer and treatment associated effects. Earlier studies have indicated that
      acupuncture can play a role in regulating immune system response to various morbidities,
      including chemotherapy induced immunosuppression. However, little research has examined is
      potential for radiation therapy patients

      This pilot study aims to assess a wide range of general immune biomarkers to identify
      biomarkers most affected by RT. Through use of a symptom assessment survey, changes in self
      reported symptoms will also be recorded. The feasibility of acupuncture as a strategy to
      ameliorate any adverse immune or symptom effects will also be examined. This information
      could be very useful in planning future studies on RT and the immune system, or the potential
      immune benefits of acupuncture.

      The main scientific question concerns the comparison of radium-223 to placebo and is best
      addressed by a randomized clinical trial. Use of placebo in this study is considered ethical,
      as provision is made for subjects to discontinue their treatment and switch to radium-223 due
      to lack of efficacy on unblinding where it influences current treatment decisions. Switch to
      rescue medication is an intercurrent event, after which it is still possible to collect the
      variable measurements as described in sections on study endpoints below. This is also the
      case after other intercurrent events such as discontinuation of radium-223 treatment due to

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and
      cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells. Colony stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, may
      increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the
      immune system recover from the side effects of combination chemotherapy. It is not yet known
      whether giving combination chemotherapy alone is more effective than combination chemotherapy
      together with G-CSF in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving combination chemotherapy together
      with G-CSF to see how well it works compared to giving combination chemotherapy alone in
      treating patients with relapsed stage I, stage II, stage III, or stage IV chronic lymphocytic

      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells and either kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Vaccines made
      from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.
      Colony-stimulating factors such as GM-CSF increase the number of immune cells found in bone
      marrow and peripheral blood. It is not yet known whether combining rituximab and GM-CSF with
      vaccine therapy may cause a stronger immune response and kill more cancer cells.

        -  Compare time to disease progression in patients with grade 1, 2, or 3 follicular B-cell
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who respond (i.e., complete or partial response, or stable
           disease) to treatment with rituximab and are then treated with sargramostim (GM-CSF)
           with vs without autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine.

      Secondary

        -  Compare response rate improvement in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall complete response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare duration of response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to prior treatment (yes vs no) and response to rituximab during
      study (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] vs stable disease [SD]).

      All patients receive rituximab IV once weekly for 4 weeks. Five weeks after the last dose of
      rituximab, patients are assessed for response. Patients with progressive disease are removed
      from the study and do not undergo randomization. Patients with a CR, PR, or SD are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive autologous immunoglobulin idiotype-KLH conjugate vaccine
           subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days
           1-4.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo SC on day 1. Patients also receive GM-CSF SC on days
           1-4.

      In both arms, treatment repeats monthly for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or clinically significant progressive disease. After the first 6 months, patients with a CR,
      PR, or SD may continue to receive treatment (per treatment arm as above) every 2 months for 1
      year (total of 6 doses) and then every 3 months thereafter in the absence of disease
      progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months until disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 342 evaluable patients (171 per treatment arm) will be accrued
      for this study within 18 months.

      Background

      Patients with cancer and a first deep venous thrombosis of the leg or pulmonary embolism
      (venous thromboembolism, VTE) are generally treated with low molecular weight heparin
      (LMWH)injections for 6 months, since this treatment is associated with a reduced incidence of
      recurrent VTE compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKA). It is recommended that patients with
      active malignancy (metastatic cancer and/or ongoing cancer treatment)continue anticoagulant
      treatment. However, it is unknown whether LMWH is still superior compared to VKA for the
      long-term anticoagulant treatment.

      Aim

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether low-molecular-weight heparin more effectively
      reduces recurrent VTE compared to vitamin K antagonists in patients with cancer who have
      already completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant treatment because of deep venous thrombosis
      of the leg or pulmonary embolism.

      Hypothesis

      The investigators hypothesize that LMWH is more effective compared to VKA in the long-term
      treatment of VTE in cancer patients who have already been treated for 6-12 months with
      anticoagulants.

      Design

      This is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, open label trial.

      Patients

      Patients with a malignancy (all types, solid and hematological) who have received 6-12 months
      of anticoagulation for VTE and have an indication for continuing anticoagulation, will be
      randomly assigned to six additional months of LMWH or VKA. LMWH will be administered in a
      weight-adjusted scheme, with 65-75% of therapeutic doses. All types of LMWH and VKA are
      allowed, as long as weight adjusted dosing is possible for LMWH. The target INR will be
      2.0-3.0. The primary efficacy outcome is symptomatic recurrent VTE, i.e. deep vein thrombosis
      and pulmonary embolism. The primary safety outcome is major bleeding.

      Sample size

      A total of 65 to 87 recurrent VTE events are needed to show a 50% reduction with LMWH as
      compared to VKA (type I error 0.05, two-sided, power respectively 80 and 90%). To observe 75
      events, with a 10% event rate per half year in the VKA arm and 5% in the LMWH arm a total of
      1000 patients will need to be included.

      Organisation

      Outcomes will be adjudicated by a central adjudication committee. A steering committee will
      be formed, preferably consisting of one member of every participating center. An electronic
      case report form will be used for data collection. Also, an electronic trial master file will
      be used.
    ",Long-term Treatment for Cancer Patients With Deep Venous Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism,"['Venous Thromboembolism', 'Neoplasms']","['Pulmonary Embolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Embolism', 'Thromboembolism', 'Venous Thromboembolism', 'Venous Thrombosis']","
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism
      (PE), represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. 1 The risk of
      VTE is increased several-fold in patients with cancer with incidences ranging between 4% and
      20%. 2 Treatment of VTE aims at preventing recurrent events, including potentially fatal PE,
      which in turn could reduce the morbidity, use of health care resources and, above all,
      mortality for cancer patients.

      Standard treatment for VTE consists of an initial course of heparin followed by vitamin K
      antagonists (VKAs) with doses adjusted to maintain an international normalized ratio (INR)
      between 2.0 and 3.0. Several unique aspects related to the cancer itself and its management
      make VKA therapy more complex than in non cancer patients. Chemotherapy induced
      thrombocytopenia and invasive procedures, for instance, may require a temporary interruption
      of anticoagulant therapy and a prompt reversal of the anticoagulant effect. On the other
      side, poor nutrition, concomitant medications, and impaired liver function can cause
      unpredictable changes in the dose response of VKAs. In addition, VKAs seem less effective and
      safe in cancer patients who experience a 3-fold higher risk of VTE recurrence and a 3-fold
      higher risk of bleeding during anticoagulation compared to patients without cancer. 3-5 Most
      bleeding and thrombotic complications occur with anticoagulant parameters within the
      therapeutic range. Therefore, more aggressive anticoagulant therapy would have the potential
      to reduce the risk of recurrent VTE, but at the price of an increase in bleeding.

      Recently, randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies in cancer patients with
      acute VTE have shown that low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) may be more effective in
      preventing VTE recurrences at a comparable bleeding risk as compared to VKA's. 6-9 In
      addition, LMWH offer the advantages of being easier to administer, more flexible, and not
      influenced by nutrition problems or liver impairment.

      In the CLOT (Randomized Comparison of Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin Versus Oral Anticoagulant
      Therapy for the Prevention of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Cancer)
      study, cancer patients with acute, symptomatic proximal DVT, PE, or both, were randomly
      assigned to receive dalteparin (200 IU/kg of body weight subcutaneously once daily for 5 to 7
      days) followed by a coumarin derivative for 6 months, or dalteparin alone for 6 months (200
      IU/kg of body weight once daily for 1 month followed by 150 IU/kg body weight once daily for
      5 months). During the 6-month study period, 27 of 336 patients (9%) in the dalteparin group
      had symptomatic, objectively documented recurrent VTE as compared to 53 of 336 patients (17%)
      in the VKAs group, hazard ratio 0.48 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.77, p=0.002). There was no
      statistically significant difference in major bleeding (6% versus 4%, p=0.27) nor in any
      bleeding (14% and 19%, respectively, p=0.09) between the two study groups. 6 In a randomized,
      open-label multicenter trial, subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium (1.5 mg/kg once daily) was
      compared with warfarin given for 3 months in 146 cancer patients with VTE. 7 Fifteen (21.1%)
      of the 71 assessable patients assigned to receive warfarin had one major bleeding or a
      recurrent VTE within 3 months compared with seven patients (10.5%) of the 67 assessable
      patients assigned to receive enoxaparin (p=0.09). There were six deaths as a result of
      hemorrhage in the warfarin group compared with none in the enoxaparin group.

      In a RCT of 122 cancer patients with acute symptomatic VTE, no significant differences in
      major and minor bleeding rates were observed between patients assigned to subcutaneous
      enoxaparin given for up to 180 days and those receiving enoxaparin followed by warfarin. 8 In
      the LITE (Longitudinal Investigation of Thromboembolism Etiology) study, cancer patients with
      acute symptomatic proximal DVT were randomized to intravenous UFH followed by VKAs for 3
      months or tinzaparin (175 U/kg once daily) alone for 3 months. During the 1-year
      observational period, recurrent VTE occurred in 16 of 100 (16%) patients assigned to UFH-VKAs
      compared with 7 of 100 cancer patients (7%) treated with tinzaparin. 9 The American Society
      of Clinical Oncology and the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines advice LMWH for
      acute and long-term treatment in cancer patients with acute VTE. 10-11 The US Food and Drug
      Administration has recently approved dalteparin sodium for long-term treatment of symptomatic
      VTE in cancer patients. 12 Long-term anticoagulant therapy with VKAs is suggested when LMWH
      is not available.

      After 6 months of LMWH, indefinite anticoagulant therapy is suggested for patients with
      active cancer, such as those with metastases or receiving chemotherapy. These patients are
      considered to be at a greater risk for recurrent VTE. For most patients, this means lifelong
      anticoagulation. The relative benefits and risks of continuing LMWH beyond 6 months versus
      switching to oral VKAs, remains a clinical judgment in the individual patient. Some experts
      in the field recommend VKAs in patients with less advanced disease. 13 The risks of long-term
      LMWH therapy include bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. While
      heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and clinically relevant osteoporosis seems relatively
      uncommon, the incidence of major and overall bleeding appears to be comparable between LMWH
      and VKAs at least for the first 3-6 months of therapy. 6-8 The costs of long-term LMWH
      administration which exceeds by far that of VKAs 14 as well as the patient's preference
      should be taken into account when deciding on the optimal long-term VTE prophylaxis.

      The optimal anticoagulant prophylaxis in cancer patients with VTE who have completed 6 months
      of LMWH remains a dilemma. While current guidelines by the American Society of Clinical
      Oncology and the American College of Chest Physicians advice lifelong LMWH, these
      recommendations remain based solely on expert consensus in the absence of clinical trial
      data. A recent worldwide survey has shown that VKAs remain the most commonly used long-term
      in cancer patients. 15 The aim of this study is to evaluate whether LMWHs are superior to
      VKAs in the long-term treatment of symptomatic VTE in cancer patients who completed 6 to 12
      months of anticoagulant treatment. As stated above, both medicines have been used for over a
      decade and their side-effects are widely known. In this study, we will only dictate which
      anticoagulant should be used for long-term treatment, not whether anticoagulant treatment is
      indicated.

      The purpose of this study is to compare treatment with the new drug sirolimus (SRL) versus
      the standard treatment with cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus in children who have received
      kidney transplants. SRL is a new medication that may prevent the body's immune system from
      rejecting organ transplants.

      After receiving a kidney transplant, the body recognizes the donated kidney as a foreign
      invader and triggers the immune system to attack the kidney. This can lead to rejection of
      the new kidney and a failed transplant. To help reduce the risk of kidney rejection,
      transplant patients are given immunosuppressant drugs, which reduce the body's normal immune
      response and allow the transplanted organ to function. CsA or tacrolimus are two drugs that
      are often given to transplant patients. However, these are powerful drugs, and it can cause
      serious side effects and put a patient at increased risk for infections. SRL is a new drug
      that has been shown to reduce a transplant patient's chance of rejecting a new kidney,
      without serious side effects. This study is necessary to test the safety and effectiveness of
      SRL in children.
    ",A Study to Compare Treatment With Sirolimus Versus Standard Treatment in Patients Who Have Received a Kidney Transplant,"['End-Stage Renal Disease', 'Kidney Transplantation']","Kidney Failure, Chronic","
      Successful kidney transplantation has gradually improved over the years; much of the
      improvement has resulted from the use of CsA. However, adequate and tolerable
      immunosuppression is difficult to achieve with CsA, and rejection episodes are still
      frequent. CsA is nephrotoxic, with drug toxicity often masking rejection episodes. Other
      immunosuppressant therapies can result in a range of complications, including metabolic
      disturbances, adrenocortical insufficiency, and increased risk for infections. Therefore,
      more effective drugs with less toxicity are needed to prevent acute rejection, especially in
      the pediatric population where the overall graft survival rate remains significantly lower
      when compared with that of adult transplant recipients. SRL is an immunosuppressive agent
      being developed for the prophylaxis of acute renal allograft rejection. SRL has a unique
      mechanism of action. It inhibits T and B cell activity. In Phase I and II trials in adults,
      SRL was generally well tolerated and exhibited no apparent nephrotoxic properties, and
      significantly lower rates of rejection were seen with SRL when compared to placebo.

      Patients receive extensive prestudy screening, which includes a renal core biopsy, chest
      x-ray, bone density study, blood tests, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Patients are
      then randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio (142 patients receive
      SRL, CsA/tacrolimus, and corticosteroids and 71 patients receive standard CsA or
      tacrolimus-based double or triple drug therapy). SRL is administered as an oral dose of 3
      mg/m2/day. Patients are followed for 3 years on therapy, and then for 1 month of follow-up. A
      renal core biopsy is performed at the time of study entry and at Months 6, 18, and at early
      termination of patient in study. Patients undergo physical examinations and various blood
      tests at specified time intervals during the 37-month study period. Efficacy is assessed by
      comparing the composite endpoint of biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death after
      36 months of treatment. Safety is assessed by comparing the composite endpoint of graft loss
      or death after 36 months of treatment.

      T-cell and B-cell depletion in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation by using
      immunomagnetic negative and positive selection procedures

      Background:

      Removal of T-cells from the donor graft (T-cell depletion) offers the possibility for
      prevention of GVHD and subsequently less transplant related morbidity and mortality after
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). There are several techniques to deplete T-cells
      from the stem cell grafts e.g. physical, immunological and combined physical / immunological
      separation methods. All these techniques result in a stem cell graft with sufficient CD34+
      stem cells combined with an adequate depletion of T and B cells. CD34+ selected stem cell
      grafts are very pure and do not contain any additional cell populations. In contrast,
      CD3+/CD19+ depleted grafts still contain NK-cells, monocytes and dendritic cells that are
      part of the innate immune system. Theoretically,the presence of these cells may positively
      influence immunological reconstitution and the graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect,
      respectively, resulting in improved outcome after SCT

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the differences in immunological reconstitution, transplant related mortality,
      disease-free survival and overall survival after T-cell depleted allogeneic SCT for
      haematological malignancies using either immunomagnetic CD34+ selection or immunomagnetic
      CD3+/CD19+ depletion using the CliniMACS system in approximately 270 consecutive patients.

      Additionally in this study in 20 consecutive patients the kinetics of NK-cel reconstitution
      and differences in NK-cell repertoire will be monitored. NK-cell mediated anti-tumor
      reactivity will be monitored in patients transplanted with and without NK-cells in the stem
      cell graft (CD3+/CD19+ depletion, versus CD34+ selection). Secondary objectives are to
      evaluate the clinical relevance of minor histocompatibility-specific cytotoxic T-cell
      responses for the GVL effect, the kinetics of NK-cell reconstitution and differences in
      NK-cell repertoire using the different T-cell depletion protocols.

      Design:

      Single center prospective randomised phase III study

      Population:

      Patients eligible for allogeneic SCT according to the standard criteria of our institution
      who will receive an allogeneic T- and B-cell depleted SCT with peripheral stem cells of an
      HLA-identical sibling donor or an HLA-identical unrelated voluntary (VUD) donor.

      Intervention:

      T-cell depletion will be conducted using two different techniques: either immunomagnetic
      CD34+ selection or immunomagnetic CD3+/CD19+ depletion.

      Endpoints:

      Primary endpoints are immunological reconstitution, relapse, disease free survival and
      overall survival. Secondary endpoints: NK-cell reconstitution and NK-cell mediated
      anti-tumour reactivity. Cytotoxic T-cell responses for the GVL effect.

      Estimated efforts and risks for participating patients:

      We don't expect any extra patient efforts or risks because T-cell depletion is a standard
      procedure in our clinic for many years. There is extensive experience with immunological
      T-cell depletion techniques. We hypothesize CD3+/CD19+ depletion will favour stem cell
      transplant outcome. Immunological and molecular biological studies will be performed on blood
      samples already obtained as part of the standard protocol.

      This open, multicentric, randomized, controlled study is planned to evaluate the correlation
      between gene expression, spontaneous catch-up growth and therapeutic response to Saizen in
      SGA children.
    ","A Trial to Evaluate the Correlation Between Spontaneous Catch-up Growth, Clinical Response to Saizen (Recombinant Human Growth Hormone, r-hGH) and Gene Expression Profiling in Children Small for Gestational Age (SGA)","Infant, Small for Gestational Age",,"
      This open, multicentric, randomized, controlled study was planned to identify genes activated
      by hGH in SGA children responders to treatment (making it possible in the near future to
      better identify SGA children likely to benefit from hGH treatment). Furthermore, the study
      would hopefully allow to verify which genes were responsible of spontaneous catch-up growth
      in children with diagnosis of SGA at birth but above the third percentile for height at the
      age of 24 months, and if these genes were the same activated by hGH during the treatment in
      participants responders. Sixty children born at term (i.e. after the 37th completed week of
      gestation) and with a diagnosis of SGA (defined as a length less than tenth percentile
      according to the Italian reference table published by Bertini and Fabris) were planned to be
      enrolled in the study. Forty participants (group A) were still less than third percentile for
      height (according to the Tanner reference table) at the age of 24 months, the remaining 20
      (group B) being more than or equal to third percentile (thus showing a spontaneous catch-up
      growth). Group A was randomized to receive Saizen at the daily dose of 0.067 mg/kg (Group A1)
      or no treatment (Group A2) for two years. All participants were to undergo full clinical
      examination and blood chemistry at baseline visit and visit after 1,6,12,18 and 24 months for
      a period of two years. Gene expression analysis using the Clontech Atlas Human Array was
      performed in all participants at baseline and after one year in order to identify the
      possible correlation between catch-up growth (either spontaneous or drug-induced) and
      expression of some genes.

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid cancers worldwide, and chronic
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the most common etiology of HCC in Asia. Transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) is the standard treatment for patients with unresectable HCC in the
      BCLC intermediate stage, but the HCC recurrence rates and long-term mortality rates are quite
      high. These intermediate-staged HCC patients usually need repeated TACE due to tumor
      recurrence, and they may die of HCC progression or liver decompensation after repeated TACE.
      Improved liver function and decreased liver disease progression due to oral antiviral therapy
      have been proven to be effective for chronic hepatitis B, and oral antiviral therapy may keep
      better liver reserve and provide better chance for HCC patients received TACE. In addition,
      chronic HBV infection is one of the most important factors for HCC development, and antiviral
      therapy can improve the outcomes after curative treatment. However, the evidence of improving
      outcomes of HCC patients underwent TACE by oral antiviral therapy is lacking. Moreover,
      Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) is one of the most potent oral antiviral agents, and its
      safety and very low long-term viral resistance rate have been also reported. There is no
      study to evaluate the impacts of TDF for HBV-related HCC patients underwent TACE. Until now,
      routine antiviral therapy for HBV-related HCC patients underwent TACE has still not been
      recommended by current guidelines. The hypothesis of this study is that a potent oral
      antiviral therapy for patients with HBV-related HCC patients receiving TACE improve patients'
      outcomes

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of 1.25% povidone-iodine
      ophthalmic solution for the treatment of small to medium sized fungal corneal ulcers compared
      with an antifungal antibiotic.
    ",A Clinical Trial of the Treatment of Fungal Corneal Ulcers With Povidone-Iodine,Fungal Keratitis,"['Corneal Ulcer', 'Keratitis']","
      The medication to be studied is 1.25% povidone-iodine solution and the control medication is
      5% natamycin ophthalmic suspension. The povidone-iodine concentration of 1.25% was chosen
      based on a study using povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution for the first week after ocular
      surgery. Initially, some patients complained of a stinging sensation when using the 2.5%
      concentration. This might prevent full compliance from some subjects. When the solution was
      diluted to 1.25%, there were no more complaints of discomfort. Therefore, in the actual
      one-week postoperative clinical trial, the 1.25 % concentration was used without any patient
      complaints and it was found to be effective. In a pilot study conducted in the Philippines,
      investigating treatment of small to medium-sized fungal corneal ulcers, 1.25% povidone-iodine
      was shown to be effective against fungal corneal ulcers including those caused by Fusarium
      solani and Mycelia sterila when treated for 7-20 days.

      The povidone-iodine 1.25% solution will be prepared by removing 1.875 ml. of solution from a
      15 ml. bottle of Balanced Salt Solution (BSS), (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth) and
      inserting 1.875 ml. of a 10% povidone-iodine solution (Betadine solution, Purdue Frederick,
      Norwalk). Preparations will be made weekly for each subject using sterile technique and are
      to be stored in a cool dark place. The control anti-fungal will be natamycin ophthalmic
      suspension, USP 5% (Natamet, M.J. Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Mumbai, India), which represents the
      current standard of care. The subjects will be discharged home on the same randomized
      medication that they were assigned while hospitalized.

      Prospective candidates for the study, and/or their parent or guardian, will review the
      appropriate Human Subjects Consent Form, approved by the Human Subjects Protection Committee
      of the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. After written consents, Informed and HIPPA, are obtained,
      each subject will be randomized to receive either povidone-iodine or the control drug. All
      subjects will be hospitalized for a minimum duration of 7 days for careful monitoring and
      appropriate treatment. To assure compliance, all these inpatient subjects will have their
      medications administered by medical personnel. Upon admission, the intake clinical
      examination will be recorded.

      Each infected eye will be randomly assigned by the research nurse to be treated with
      povidone-iodine 1.25% or the control, anti-fungal medication natamycin. Randomization will be
      achieved by using random number generated randomization schedules. To guarantee similar
      distribution will occur, and not be left to chance, each study site randomization schedule
      will be stratified on ulcer sizes < 3mm. and > 3mm.

      The only eye medications permitted beside povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution and the
      control drug natamycin, will be atropine ophthalmic solution to reduce intraocular
      inflammation and prevent synechiae, and anti-glaucoma medication as needed. The atropine will
      be administered to the affected eye(s) twice a day and strength will vary according to the
      subject's age. Subjects less than 1 year of age will be given atropine 0.25%, ages 1-3 will
      be given 0.5%, and subjects greater than 3 years of age will be given 1%.

      The dosing schedule of povidone-iodine 1.25% or control medication is as follows:

        1. For the first three days, one drop of the medication will be applied every hour.

        2. Day 4 and thereafter, hourly while awake, when asleep, every three hours. Sleep is not
           to exceed 9 hours. Treat all cases with intense drop therapy for a minimum of 5 days
           unless criteria for change in therapy are met.

        3. At 5 days, decrease dosing frequency to every 2 hours while awake until ""cured"", only if
           no deterioration in any factor and improved in at least one factor, other than
           epithelial defect, is noted on 2 consecutive examinations.

        4. If at 10 days the status remains unchanged, the subject is to exit the study.

      The prevention of MTCT during pregnancy and through breastfeeding exposure remains
      challenging to date in most resource-limited settings. Peripartum HIV transmission is already
      amenable to ARV interventions. These ARV regimens, partially efficacious are insufficiently
      used despite their apparent simplicity. The postnatal transmission via breastfeeding remains
      a serious additional threat.

      This is a multicentric, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial aiming at assessing the
      maternal and infant safety of a single daily fixed-dose combination of TDF/FTC/EFV
      (Atripla®), compared to the association of LPV/r (Kaletra® or Aluvia®) and 3TC/ZDV
      (Combivir®) given to African women (in Cote d'Ivoire an in Zambia) to prevent MTCT overall in
      breastfeeding population.

      The fixed-dose combination of Tenofovir/Emtricitabine/Efavirenz (TDF/FTC/EFV or Atripla®) is
      a highly effective HAART combination and the simplest ARV regimen currently available in
      resource-limited settings and is therefore likely to become soon the lead first-line HAART
      regimen for adults in such settings. Its anticipated widespread prescription in women of
      childbearing age requires the proper documentation of its use in pregnancy and during
      breastfeeding.

      The combination of ZDV/3TC (Combivir®) and Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (Kaletra® or Aluvia®)
      is chosen as a reference regimen as it is one of the most commonly used first-line HAART for
      adults and the reference regimen for PMTCT in industrialised settings.

      The maternal ARV regimen will be initiated as soon as possible from 20 weeks of gestation
      until at least the cessation of breastfeeding (with the advice to cease at six months). The
      decision to stop or continue the maternal ARV regimen after breastfeeding cessation will be
      based on the baseline maternal CD4 count and the maternal clinical stage at baseline and/or
      at breastfeeding cessation. A woman with a baseline CD4 <500 cells/ml will always be proposed
      to continue her treatment after breastfeeding cessation. A woman with a baseline CD4 count
      >500 will be asked to stop her treatment after breastfeeding cessation unless she has reached
      the WHO clinical stage IV at that time.

      Infants will receive daily Zidovudine syrup from birth during the first week of life, or an
      updated ARV post-exposure prophylaxis recommended by WHO when women receive HAART.

      The control of postoperative pain has become a major issue in surgery awareness and it is
      considered an important measurement of patient satisfaction. Improvements in pain relief,
      including stopping pain before it starts (i.e. preemptive treatment) is of great benefit to
      the surgical patient. When pain is aggressively addressed, patients respond by recovering
      faster.

      The use of opioids remains the mainstay to minimize postoperative pain. Lately, long acting
      local anesthetic wound infiltration has been widely recognized as a useful adjunct to
      multimodal postoperative pain management. On that basis, a system that delivers a continuous
      local anesthetic to the surgical wound was developed, and better pain control has been
      achieved after several surgical procedures.

      In patients undergoing abdominal procedures, such as colon resection, adequate pain control
      remains an issue. It is known that innervation to the antero-lateral abdomen is provided by
      sensory nerves T7-L1, ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves, which travel through the
      transverse abdominis muscle plane (TAP). Local anesthetic block of these nerves has been
      described and has shown to be effective for immediate postoperative pain control.

      Recently, the use of the On-Q pain relief system with catheters placed within the TAP has
      been evaluated. Published results have shown significant improvement of pain control
      (Forastiere). The idea of placing the pain catheters at the TAP plane seems to be more
      coherent with the anatomical distribution of the sensory nerves trunks. Due to the lack of
      prospective trials investigating the effectiveness of a continuous wound infusion with local
      anesthetics after general surgery procedures the investigators sought to determine the
      efficacy of this technique after laparoscopic colon resection procedures.

      In patients with SCD, the use of low dose anticoagulation as an outpatient may lead to a
      significant decrease in morbidity and as a result, decrease healthcare utilization and costs.
      This study attempts to critically avoid admissions by reducing daily pain scores and pain
      crisis as an outpatient by use of a novel oral anticoagulant.
    ",Apixaban in Patients With Sickle Cell Disease,"['Vaso-occlusive Crisis', 'Reduction in Hospitalizations', 'Sickle Cell Disease']","Anemia, Sickle Cell","
      There is not only significant morbidity associated with patients with SCD, but also costs
      associated with the numerous hospitalizations. Small studies have been unable to show clear
      benefit of the use of low dose anticoagulation in SCD due to limited sample size or the
      inclusion of very specific populations. However, studies have shown a decrease in the level
      of elevated prothrombotic markers with anticoagulation, and one study using full dose
      anticoagulation in patients with a generally milder form of SCD (with high protective
      hemoglobin) showed more rapid decrease in clinical pain with use of anticoagulation,
      suggesting a possible benefit of such therapy. Due to the paucity of data to support
      therapeutic dose LMWH in the more severe forms of SCD seen in the United States, we have
      chosen prophylactic dose anticoagulation. This study proposal attempts to critically avoid
      admissions by reducing daily pain scores and pain crisis as an outpatient by use of a novel
      oral anticoagulant.

      The development of novel anticoagulants such as oral direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors allows
      the realistic use of daily prophylactic dosing as an outpatient. Past studies as detailed
      earlier have been limited by attempts to use subcutaneous injections or frequent, close
      monitoring for acenocoumarol treatment, both which are not ideal for chronic daily use.
      Furthermore, the use of global assays such calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) have
      shown further details about thrombin generation in a population which is hypercoagulable at
      baseline.

      This is a double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled feasibility study with an
      enrollment target of 25 patients (12 per arm). All subjects that meet inclusion criteria as
      an outpatient, following a 1 month observation, will be randomized to receive an oral
      prophylactic dose factor Xa inhibitor (Apixaban 2.5mg po bid) or placebo for 6 months.
      Subjects will return for a 30 day (+/- 5 days) follow-up visit after the End of Treatment
      (EOT) visit. Initial randomization will occur by computerized randomization technique by the
      investigational drug services (IDS) at Duke University Medical Center.

      The purpose of this research study is to look at two of the common forms of treatment for
      this condition: physical therapy and epidural steroid injection. The investigators are
      attempting to evaluate whether or not physical therapy alone, or epidural steroid injections
      alone, are effective in treating this condition. The investigators will also try to determine
      whether or not one of these treatments is better than the other for the treatment of
      herniated discs with nerve injury (radiculopathy).

      1. Potential research participants identified from clinic population.

             -  40 subjects will be enrolled in each group (TFESI and PT). An additional 40
                subjects will be enrolled into the concurrent observational cohort.

             -  Appropriate study subjects will be identified upon initiation of care (MD
                evaluation and/or physical therapy). They will have pain of less than or equal to
                three months duration, within the current pain episode. This may be the initial
                pain episode or the onset of a most recent episode of pain, preceded by at least a
                six month pain free interval. They will have focal disc protrusion with correlating
                radicular symptoms and possible radicular/neurological deficits. These radicular
                symptoms/signs are defined as pain or paresthesias below the knee, pain
                reproduction with straight-leg-raising and/or extension or quadrant maneuvers, and
                radicular pattern sensory, reflex or strength changes. These symptoms will be
                consistent with the level of nerve root impingement. Only subjects with
                radiculopathy primarily at L5 and/or S1, due to pathology at L4-5 and/or L5-S1 disc
                levels will be included. Those with canal and foraminal compromise due to disc
                protrusion at L4-5 with L5 > L4 signs and symptoms WILL be included. Those with
                predominantly degenerative stenosis, degenerative spondylolisthesis, or
                spondylolysis will be excluded.

           Subjects also need to have an eleven point Likert pain scale score greater than or equal
           to four. They will not have a history of prior epidural steroid injections within the
           prior year or prior lumbar surgery.

           -Upon entry to the study, baseline measurements of the patient's pain and function will
           be established. The primary outcome measure for this study will be reduction in pain as
           measured by a three day average Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Secondary measures will
           include: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), SF-36, a seven point Global Perception of
           Change (GPC), a three question Patient Specific Activity questionnaire (PSAQ) (each
           patient will list 3 cardinal activities of daily living that are restricted or rendered
           impossible because of their pain and will score each item), and utilization of
           analgesic, outside medical care, and surgical options, as well as physician physical
           exam test parameters and lost productivity.

        5. Randomization to TFESI or PT group, if subject declines then inquire about enrolment in
           the observational cohort. Participants in this group (Cohort) will chose their treatment
           (per-protocol physical therapy, injections, or both) after consulting with their
           physicians.

        6. Injection: Anesthetic/corticosteroid (per randomization); repeat 1-3 times if clinically
           indicated.

           The following drugs will be used for this procedure: 80mg Depo-Medrol and 1% lidocaine.

           These drugs used for the epidural injections are local anesthetic numbing medicines and
           cortisone/steroid anti-inflammatory medicines.

           (VAS, SF-36, ODI, GPC, PSAQ, work history, analgesic use log, lost productivity and
           ancillary treatment log).

             -  At the 4 week follow-up, subjects who are not satisfied with treatment will be
                provided the option to cross-over to the alternate treatment group.

      Participants in the control group will chose their treatment (per-protocol physical therapy,
      injections, or both) after consulting with their physicians.

      Recently intraperitoneal nebulization of local anesthetic has been used as an alternative to
      direct intraperitoneal instillation. Intraperitoneal aerosolization of Bupivacaine 50 mg
      after laparoscopic cholecystectomy significantly reduced postoperative pain, morphine
      consumption and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and it is associated with
      rapid mobilization compared with patients receiving direct instillation of Bupivacaine 50 mg
      or placebo.

      In a recent study the investigators found that nebulization of Ropivacaine 30 mg with the
      AeronebPro® before or after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and gynecologic laparoscopic surgery
      reduces postoperative pain and morphine consumption. Patients receiving preoperative
      nebulization of Ropivacaine presented significantly less postoperative pain (-50% clinical
      setting) and consumed significant less morphine (-50% and -40% respectively) than patients in
      control groups during the first 48 hours after surgery.

      The effects of peritoneal nebulization of ropivacaine during laparoscopic colectomy on pain
      control and morphine consumption were not evaluated.

      The investigators hypothesize that intraperitoneal nebulization of Ropivacaine may produce

      The Specific Aim of this project is to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of
      continuous oral contraceptives versus leuprolide/norethindrone in the treatment of
      endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain. This comparison will be based on a randomized,
      double-blind, trial of women with chronic pelvic pain who have been diagnosed with
      endometriosis at the time of surgery within the last 3 years. We hypothesize that, over a
      12-month period of postoperative treatment, the efficacy of oral contraceptives is no worse
      than leuprolide/norethindrone, and that treatment with oral contraceptives is more
      cost-effective.

      -  Background-Laparoscopic surgical treatment for endometriosis is typically associated
           with a decrease of pain on a short-term basis, but 50% of patients have pain 12 months
           after surgery. Often this leads to having repeat surgery to treat the endometriosis.
           Instead of having repeat surgery, some physicians use medications to prevent the pain
           and endometriosis from returning.

        -  The purpose of this study is to compare continuous oral contraceptives to
           depot-leuprolide for control of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain after surgical
           treatment of endometriosis. We will also be looking at the potential cost savings of
           using oral contraceptives compared to depot-leuprolide, as depot-leuprolide is an
           expensive medication.

        -  If the patient meets criteria, including confirmation of diagnosis of endometriosis, she
           will then undergo an intake visit consisting of obtaining informed consent and
           completion of several baseline questionnaires. This intake visit is estimated to last
           1-2 hours. After informed consent has been obtained, the subject will be randomized to
           one of the two treatment groups:One tablet of oral contraceptives (birth control pills)
           everyday and an injection of saline (a sterile salt solution with no medication effect)
           every 12 weeks for 48 weeks or One tablet of norethindrone everyday and an injection of
           depot-leuprolide every 12 weeks for 48 weeks.

           will be recorded and a urine pregnancy test will be obtained. The Study Coordinator will
           review with the patient any concerns she might have and record any adverse events.
           Assessments of pain and quality of life will be made at weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 after
           the intake visit. An injection (leuprolide acetate or saline plus inert powder) will be
           given by an unblinded nurse at the intake visit, and at weeks 12, 24, and 36. In
           addition, at the end of each medication visit, the patient will be given a three month's
           supply of oral medication (capsules containing norethindrone acetate or a generic oral

      The objective of our research is to determine whether treatment with magnesium will reduce
      the incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Several small
      studies of magnesium have already been conducted, but these studies were small and the
      results conflicting. A large, well-conducted study of magnesium treatment is required to
      definitively determine whether magnesium is effective in preventing this common complication
      after surgery. In addition, our study will include patients undergoing valvular surgery, a
      group previously excluded from research despite the fact that they are at increased risk of
      atrial fibrillation.

      up to 7 days, providing more time for the lungs to improve.

      Extrapolating from large animal data, the hypothesis is that the Hattler Catheter will be

      The Hattler Catheter Respiratory Assist Device consists of a Catheter and a drive console.
      The catheter consists of a bundle of polypropylene hollow fibers (approximately 1000) in 30cm

      To date, there is no efficient therapeutics to prevent or treat COVID-19 related pulmonary
      failure. Corticosteroids (CS) could be a helpful therapeutic. Retrospective reports suggested
      survival improvement in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). CT scan for
      COVID19 hospitalized patients showed sometimes unusual aspects of pneumonia, suggestive of an
      organizing phase of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD).

      ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome"" coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a new coronavirus that
      induces pneumonia called Corona Virus Disease- 19 (COVID-19), an infected 1.5 million people
      worldwide and caused the more than 85,000 patients died. COVID-19 usually comes in the form
      of viral pneumonia but with the peculiarities of a risk frequent worsening towards acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a usual duration of oxygen dependence in fragile
      patients by their age or their comorbidities. To date, there is no therapy effective in
      preventing or treating COVID-19. Drug identification is a major concern and a public health
      emergency. Retrospective study (Wu 2020) highlighted improved survival in COVID-19 patients
      with acute ARDS and treated with corticosteroids (CS). So even in the absence of evidence of
      effectiveness, the SCs are used for COVID-19 oxygen-dependent patients or with an ARDS.
      However, their benefit / risk remains debated (Russel 2020). On histological samples of
      COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) has been especially observed (Hanley 2020). DAD is
      described histologically in an exudative phase, an organizational phase and a irreversible
      fibrotic phase (Hughes 2017). SC could have an effect beneficial by limiting the exudative /
      inflammatory phase but also that organization whose histological and CT aspects are sometimes
      indistinguishable from organized pneumonia, a form of pulmonary repair aberrant very
      corticosensitive (Travis 2013). Chest scans performed in the face of the persistence or
      worsening of oxygen dependence beyond the 7th day of COVID-19 symptoms, could help discern
      indirect complications (pulmonary embolism, exacerbation of COPD, bacterial superinfection,
      etc.) of an unfavorable course COVID-19 (by displaying an aspect suggesting DAD in particular
      during the organization phase). We hypothesize that, in the context of COVID-19, the SCs may
      be beneficial in patients with CT scans thoracic images suggestive of DAD either at the
      exudative phase or at the pulmonary organization phase.

      Objectives: The mechanisms of tardive dyskinesia (TD) remain unclear, although
      pathophysiologic theories have proposed mechanisms such as dopamine receptor
      supersensitivity, the degeneration of cholinergic striatal interneurons, γ-aminobutyric acid
      (GABA) depletion, and an excess of free radicals.

      Prior development of second generation antipsychotic agents, tardive movement disorders were
      widespread among neuroleptics treated patients. There were great expectations of the new
      novel drugs. Unfortunately, reports about tardive movement disturbances induced by these
      medications became more and more frequent, although it has been in use for less than two
      decades.

      A recent study demonstrated that schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients suffering from TD
      had the mean level of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) below lower limit of normal range, while
      those patients without TD had normal values. At the same time, some open and double-blind
      placebo-controlled, randomized clinical studies showed that vitamin B6 was very effective in
      treatment of TD.

      Pyridoxal kinase is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of PLP, the biologically active form of
      vitamin B6. Some publications reported that the finding of high vitamin B6 levels is
      consistent with recent reports of low levels of PLP and low activity of pyridoxal kinase. It
      may explain the functional need for high-dose vitamin B6 supplementation in subjects with TD.

      Methods: A multicenter study including 300 schizophrenia and schizoaffective subjects will be
      performed. The trial will be consisted of 2 parts: the first part a single comparison
      pyridoxal kinase plasma activity in patients with and without TD; in the second part only TD
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective patients will continue. It will be a 12-week, randomized,
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Vitamin B6 (1200 mg/day) or placebo capsules will be
      added to the stable ongoing antipsychotic treatment of 150 schizophrenia patients.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline and after every 2 weeks of treatment till week 12.
      Pyridoxal kinase activity will be compared between patients who positively respond to vitamin
      B6 versus non responders. In addition, PLP levels will be monitored at baseline and at the
      end of the study.

      A battery of research tools will be used for assessment of movement disorders,
      psychopathology, and side effects. The study will be performed along a period of 2 years.

    ",Cefalium® Compared to Tylenol® in the Treatment of Migraine Attacks,Migraine,Migraine Disorders,"
      Cefalium® is a combination of Caffeine + Paracetamol + dihydroergotamine mesylate +
      metoclopramide hydrochloride. The dihydroergotamine mesylate interacts with the serotonergic,
      dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors, but it's mechanism is not totally known. The
      caffeine presents mechanisms that are not totally clear, but it may relieves the pain by
      activating of the central noradenosine pathway (pain suppressing system). The Metoclopramide
      hydrochloride presents an anti-emetic action and prokinetic action in the gastrointestinal
      tract.One of its properties is the inhibition of nausea and vomiting triggered by drugs such
      as ergotamine.Paracetamol, also called acetaminophen is an effective agent analgesic and
      antipyretic with weak anti-inflammatory activity.

      Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) provide a shock or pacing therapy to bring
      back a normal heart beat when a patient experiences a dangerous abnormal heart rhythm such as
      ventricular tachycardia (VT). ICDs are very successful in bringing back a normal heart beat
      when VT occurs, but they do not prevent further dangerous heart rhythms from occurring. This
      study is designed to determine the best way to manage patients who have an ICD and who
      continue to have episodes of VT. There are two methods for treatment the VT: 1) Ablation, and
      2) Medication.

      An ablation procedure involves placing a flexible catheter (insulated wire) in the groin area
      and threading it into the heart. After the doctor has located the affected area responsible
      for the VT, radiofrequency energy is delivered by the power generator through the catheter to
      the inside of the heart. The radiofrequency energy ablates (burns) a small area of the heart
      tissue thought to cause the VT.

      A medication called Amiodarone is an ""anti-arrhythmic"" prescribed to prevent abnormal heart
      rhythms from recurring.

      The purpose of this study is to compare these two different methods for treating VT.
      Treatment with ablation and amiodarone are both considered the standard of care for patients
      with VT but they have not been compared directly in a study like this before.

        -  Determine the sites of recurrence, incidence of second (non-breast) malignancies, and
           causes of death without relapse of breast cancer in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen (QOL portion closed
           11/13/08).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      chemotherapy (yes vs no), estrogen receptor (ER) positive and/or progesterone receptor (PR)
      positive (yes vs no), and location of recurrence (breast vs mastectomy scar/chest wall vs
      regional lymph nodes). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy* within 6 months after surgery.

        -  Arm II: Within 10 weeks after surgery, patients receive at least 3 courses of an
           adjuvant chemotherapy regimen as determined by the investigator. Patients also receive
           radiotherapy* within 6 months after surgery and after the completion of chemotherapy OR
           integrated with chemotherapy.

      NOTE: *Patients with clear margins (R0) who received prior adjuvant radiotherapy are not
      required to receive further radiotherapy

      Patients with ER and/or PR positive tumors also receive standard hormonal therapy.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 9 and 12 months (QOL portion closed 11/13/08).

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      In current obstetric anesthesia practice, epidural analgesia is the most effective technique
      to control labor pain for those women who request pain-free delivery. Epidural analgesia not
      only allows us to obtain greater pain relief and increased satisfaction of mothers, but also
      permits us to convert it to regional anesthesia in case of operative delivery, avoiding
      general anesthesia.

      One of the major concerns with epidural anesthesia in labor setting is the inability to
      produce an intensive analgesia or adequate level to proceed with cesarean section. This study
      is designed to examine the hypothesis that 10ml epidural normal saline to reduce rate of
      one-side block, low segmental block, and patch block, and improve quality of labor epidural
      analgesia/ anesthesia in obstetric population.
    ",Study to Determine Whether the Instillation of 10ml Normal Saline Improves Epidural Analgesia During Labor,Parturients,,"
      One of the major concerns with epidural anesthesia in labor setting is the inability to
      produce an intensive analgesia or adequate level to proceed with cesarean section. The
      incidence of this event is rather various among reports, reflecting variability in
      definitions, authors' clinical judgment and perception, practice parameters, hospital
      settings. In most of related studies, the term of incomplete block was used and defined as
      (1) unilateral block; (2) unblocked sacral segments; (3) low level; (4) unblocked segments or
      a patchy block. 1Reported incidence of inadequate analgesia/anesthesia was 18% to 31.8%. In
      addition, the reported incidence of intraoperative discomfort/visceral pain was from 10% to
      56%.1

      If the anesthesia/analgesia is not adequate, other treatment modalities have to be provided
      to improve pain relief, these include intravenous narcotics or ketamine, replacements of
      epidural catheter, or general anesthesia, the risks of complications may be increased by
      those managements.

      The etiology and mechanisms of failed or dysfunctional epidural analgesia or anesthesia in
      obstetrics are complex, multifactorial, and not entirely understood. Depending on the
      situation, the causes might be evident or puzzling and difficult to explain.

      Injection of fluid is frequently used for identification of the epidural space by the
      loss-of-resistance (LOR) technique. It has been shown that different volumes of saline may
      affect the subsequent epidural analgesia. Iwama showed that using 10 mL of saline as compared
      to two mL in patients undergoing elective surgery during lumbar epidural anesthesia with 2%
      mepivacaine resulted in a greater extent of anesthesia.2 Also, Okutomi et al examined the
      effect of saline volume on anesthetic levels and quality of thoracic epidural block in
      patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery. They demonstrated that the block level for cold
      after mepivacaine 1.5% was proportional to the saline volume injected, whereas the block
      level for pain was independent of the saline solution.3 Identifying the epidural space by a
      lost of resistance to air method is thought to increase the incidence of inadequate
      anesthesia. A randomized study, comparing air versus saline to identify the epidural space in
      parturients, found a higher incidence of inadequate analgesia in the air group (36% versus
      19%).4

      In parturients requesting epidural analgesia, a few studies showed that 2- 10ml normal saline
      giving to epidural space after LOR was obtained reduced the rate of venous puncture and
      unblock segments to cold and pin prick, but did not improve the visual analog pain scale or
      reduced the need for supplemental.3,5,6 No study on improvement of unilateral block, patch
      block and patients' satisfaction in obstetric setting has been found.

      We design this study to examine the hypothesis that 10ml epidural normal saline to reduce
      rate of one-side block, low segmental block, and patch block, and improve quality of labor
      epidural analgesia/ anesthesia in obstetric population.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized
      radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more
      tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy given together with radiation
      therapy is more effective with or without panitumumab in treating patients with advanced
      cancer of the hypopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, or oral cavity.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying chemotherapy given together with
      radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with chemotherapy and radiation therapy
      given together with panitumumab in treating patients who have undergone surgery for advanced
      hypopharyngeal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, or oral cavity cancer at high
      risk of recurrence.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if the addition of concurrently administered panitumumab to standard
           adjuvant chemoradiation, with 1 of 2 cisplatin-based regimens, significantly prolongs
           disease-free survival of patients with macroscopically completely resected, advanced
           squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, or oral cavity at high
           risk of recurrence.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if the pre-surgery dose of panitumumab will alter the RNA expression of
           several genes and that these changes will provide additional prognostic information that
           can be used in future patient management. (Exploratory)

        -  Measure the differences in RNA expression by RNA microarray and the results analyzed to
           create a gene expression classifier that will be checked for outcome prediction by
           association with disease free survival and down regulation of the glucose metabolism as
           measured by FDG-PET. (Exploratory)

        -  To create a European biobank of biological samples which can be used for future research
           projects in this disease. (Exploratory)

        -  To predict radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity based on in vitro lymphocyte
           apoptosis test and SNPs analysis. (Exploratory)

        -  To assess the impact of radiation-induced side effects (swallowing dysfunction and
           xerostomia) on patient's quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by treatment center,
      radiotherapy technique (3D-CRT vs IMRT), chemotherapy regimen (European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC]) vs Arbeitsgemeinschaft Radiology Oncology [ARO]
      schedule), tumor location (larynx vs oropharynx vs hypopharynx vs oral cavity), pN-stage
      (pN0-2 vs pN3), pT-stage (pT1-2 vs pT3-4), margin/extracapsular extension (ECE) status (ECE+
      and margin < 5 mm vs ECE- and margin < 5 mm vs ECE+ and margin > 5 mm), biological pre-study
      participation (yes vs no), p16 status (positive vs negative vs indeterminable). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (chemoradiotherapy): Within 4-8 weeks of surgery, patients undergo 3D-conformal or
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week in weeks 1-7. Patients also
           receive concurrent chemotherapy comprising either cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days 1,
           22, and 43 (EORTC schedule) OR cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 24
           hours on days 1-5 and 29-33 (ARO schedule), in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (chemoradiotherapy plus panitumumab): Within 4-8 weeks of surgery, patients
           undergo 3D-conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy and receive concurrent
           chemotherapy (EORTC schedule or ARO schedule) as in arm I. Patients also receive
           panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for biomarker correlative studies and translational
      research. Patients complete quality-of-life EORTC questionnaires QLQ-C30, QLQ-HN35, and
      PSS-HN periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      Intermittent claudication (IC) is caused by peripheral arterial disease and has a high
      morbidity and mortality. Etiologic factors are similar to those of cardiovascular disease.
      Primary treatment consists of cardiovascular risk management and improvement of functional
      capacity with supervised exercise therapy (SET). A potential additional therapy is the
      administration of fish oil supplements containing high amounts of omega-3 Poly Unsaturated
      Fatty Acids (PUFAs). In earlier clinical and experimental trials omega-3 PUFA's improved
      hemorheological parameters such as erythrocyte deformability and aggregation, and a number of
      cardiovascular risk factors. Hemorheological parameters determine the blood flow in the
      microcirculation, which is of main importance in patients with IC since the macrocirculation
      is compromised. Inflammation is considered an important etiologic factor in the pathogenesis
      of atherosclerosis and contributes to peripheral arterial disease Since omega-3 PUFAs also
      have a strong anti-inflammatory effect, they might be effective in patients with IC by
      lowering the inflammatory response. In addition, visceral fat rather than obesity in general
      has been recognised as an etiologic and prognostic factor in atherosclerosis.

      We hypothesise that the administration of omega-3 PUFA's in patients with IC has a
      synergistic effect with SET and improves walking distance after SET, by improving
      hemorheological parameters resulting in a better microcirculation. Second, we hypothesise
      that omega-3 PUFA's result in a less proinflammatory of whole blood in response to ex vivo
      stimulation with endotoxin. Third, we hypothesise that omega-3 PUFA's and SET result in a
      decrease in visceral fat mass.

      Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is a protein involved in the normal function of mitochondria.
      Thymidine kinase 2 deficiency (TK2d) is a form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome and is
      a very rare inherited genetic disorder. TK2d leads to abnormally low amounts of DNA in
      mitochondria and because of this defect, the mitochondria are not able to provide the energy
      that cells need to function properly, which causes severe muscle weakness, along with host of
      additional symptoms that may involve the respiration, feeding, and ambulation, and can
      progress until patients lose many of these abilities. There are no FDA-approved medicines to
      treat TK2d.

      MT1621 is a therapy that targets the underlying pathophysiology of TK2d by restoring
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication fidelity. MT1621 consists of a combination of
      deoxynucleosides (the building blocks of mtDNA) given orally. Deoxynucleoside combination
      therapy improves nucleotide balance, increases mtDNA copy number, improves cell function, and
      prolongs life in preclinical models of TK2d.

      At least 40% of the patients with prostate cancer (PC) present with positive lymph nodes
      (N1). The optimal treatment strategy for these patients remains controversial. Although
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is still often initiated as only treatment, the results
      are disappointing. Recent studies support the use of more aggressive therapies including
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and ADT. The retrospective studies supporting the
      additional use of EBRT in N1 PC patients are however not conclusive regarding to the extent
      of radiation field.

      Even after an EPLND, there might be a role for pelvic EBRT in irradicating microscopic
      disease. However pelvic irradiation irrevocably results in increased toxicity. Moreover, in
      node negative (N0) PC patients the addition of pelvic EBRT has not resulted in improved
      outcome in randomised trials. However in the setting of Tumor Node Metastasis pathological
      stage (p)N1, proven on pathological examination, PC patients this has never been evaluated so
      far. This trial aims to answer the question whether or not pelvic EBRT is beneficial in
      pathological N1 PC patients. It is also important to realise that not all pathological N1 PC
      patients have similar outcome. There is a significant impact of number of positive lymph
      nodes on outcome, with two positive nodes being suggested as a significant cut-off value in
      predicting survival in pathological N1 PC patients. By stratifying the patients according to
      the number of lymph nodes involved this study will add to the proper selection of those
      patients who will benefit most of pelvic EBRT and avoid toxicity in patients who have no
      benefit of pelvic EBRT.

      Additionally, small RNAs constitute potentially valuable markers for the diagnosis,
      prognosis, and therapeutic choices in PC patients. Blood samples will be collected to examine
      the potential role of miRNAs as a biomarker and to develop a prognostic signature for
      clinical relapse-free survival.

      The results of this trial will serve as a base for developping new trials in order to
      optimise the treatment of patients with pathological N1 PC.
    ",Evaluating the Impact of Prostate Only Versus Pelvic Radiation for N+ Prostate Cancer.,Prostate Cancer,Prostatic Neoplasms,"
      In an era with increasing evidence in favour of an aggressive local treatment, where an
      extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) is more frequently performed and with data
      supporting the potential role for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in pelvic node positive
      (N1) prostate cancer (PC), the treatment of N1 PC patients needs to be revised. Seen the lack
      of clear guidelines regarding the extent of radiation field in N1 prostate cancer patients,
      there is an urgent need for studies evaluating the place of pelvic EBRT.

      The aim of this trial is thus to evaluate if pelvic irradiation has an impact on clinical
      relapse free survival in pathological N1 PC.

      The hypothesis is that performing a pelvic EBRT after EPLND in pathological N1 PC patients
      results in a significant improved clinical relapse free survival with 15% when compared to
      prostate only EBRT.

      This will be evaluated in a multicentre Phase III stratified randomised trial randomising
      patients with PC and 1-4 positive lymph nodes on EPLND between prostate(bed) only
      radiotherapy + 2 years of ADT or pelvic radiotherapy + 2 years of androgen deprivation. A
      total of 330 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Stratification is based on the number
      of positive lymph nodes since patients with increased number of positive lymph nodes exhibit
      a poorer prognosis.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 years of treatment
      with galantamine as compared with placebo of patients who have mild to moderately severe
      Alzheimer's disease (AD).
    ",A Study of Galantamine Used to Treat Patients With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease,Alzheimer's Disease,Alzheimer Disease,"
      This is a long-term (2-year), randomized (patients will be assigned to treatment by chance),
      double blind (neither the physician nor the patient will know which treatment is assigned)
      study of galantamine versus placebo in subjects with mild to moderately-severe AD.
      Approximately 2,000 patients will participate in this study. The study length for each
      patient is approximately 25.5 months. The study consists of 3 phases: a pretreatment phase, a
      treatment phase, and a posttreatment phase. The pretreatment phase includes a 2-week
      screening period (to obtain a patient's and his or her caregiver's informed consent and to
      confirm eligibility for the study) and a baseline visit at which subjects will be randomly
      assigned, in a 1 to 1 ratio, to receive either galantamine or placebo once a day in the
      morning. Study drug will first be dispensed at the baseline visit. The treatment phase is
      composed of a titration period (the study drug will be introduced gradually) and a
      maintenance period and includes 9 visits (3 of which are conducted by telephone). The
      titration period is 12 weeks long, and visits occur about every 28 days. In the first 4 weeks
      of the titration period, subjects will receive either 8 mg galantamine or matching placebo,
      and this dose will be increased to 16 mg galantamine or placebo in the second 4 weeks. The
      dose will then be increased to 24 mg galantamine or placebo for the final 4 weeks of the
      titration period if the investigator believes the subject will benefit from and will safely
      tolerate 24 mg/day. If not, the subject may continue to receive 16 mg galantamine or placebo
      through the end of the titration period. After the titration period, subjects will enter the
      maintenance period and continue to take study drug at the dosage they received at the end of
      the titration period. This dosage may be continued through the end of the study or may be
      changed once (either up from 16 to 24 mg or down from 24 to 16 mg), depending upon the
      benefit and the safety of such a change for the individual patient as judged by the
      investigator. No dosage will exceed 24 mg/day. The posttreatment phase includes an
      End-of-Study Visit that occurs at the end of the maintenance period. A follow-up telephone
      contact (interview) is conducted 1 month after the End-of-Study Visit. The effectiveness of
      galantamine will be evaluated using the following tools: the Mini-Mental State Examination
      (MMSE); the Disability Assessment in Dementia (DAD); and the Assessment of Patient
      Accommodation Status and Caregiver Burden (APAS CarB). Safety evaluations for the study
      include the monitoring of vital status and institutionalization status, adverse events, vital
      signs, weight, physical and neurologic examinations. A Data Safety Monitoring Board, external
      to the company, has been commissioned for this study to monitor the progress of the study and
      to ensure that the safety of patients is not compromised. The effectiveness hypothesis of
      this study is that galantamine, 16 to 24 mg per day, is superior to placebo in reducing
      cognitive decline from baseline (start of study drug) as measured by the MMSE over the course
      of 2 years. The safety hypothesis is that the mortality rate in the galantamine 16 to 24 mg
      per day treatment group will be the same as that in the placebo group over the course of 2
      years.

      The antihyperglycemic effect of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of oral antidiabetic agents
      is due to their ability to increase insulin sensitivity at the cellular level, which in turn
      improves the ability of endogenous insulin to regulate glucose utilization by the tissues.
      Compounds of the sulfonylurea (SU) class act to stimulate insulin production by the pancreas,
      overcoming insulin resistance by increasing circulating insulin levels. The mechanisms of two
      kind OADs may be viewed as complementary, offering the opportunity for improved efficacy and
      durability of effect through coadministration of a TZD and a sulfonylurea.

      Successful management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requires aggressive glycemic control
      starting at the earliest stages of the disease. Rosiglitazone/glimepiride combination
      therapy, with complementary mechanisms of action, has the potential to provide significant
      benefits over monotherapy as first line therapy. Treatment with rosiglitazone/glimepiride at
      this early stage of diabetes is expected to provide better glycemic control and allow a
      greater proportion of patients to achieve target glycemic goals than oral monotherapy.

      This is the first prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study to investigate
      the effect of a GLP-1 analog, specifically liraglutide, on blood glucose levels and
      variability in subjects with type 1 diabetes treated with insulin. Liraglutide is the
      preferred GLP-1 analog for this study because the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      the drug are consistent with a sustained duration of action. The current gold standard for
      management of type 1 diabetes is based on insulin replacement with novel analogs with
      specified pharmacodynamic profiles or with unique insulin delivery systems (insulin pump
      therapy). No other adjuvant therapy has demonstrated sustained benefit in this population.
      This study will also investigate the effect of liraglutide on suppression of glucagon
      secretion during meal challenges. This is of particular importance since, in the absence of
      insulin secretion from the β-cell, there is no paracrine inhibition of glucagon secretion by
      the α-cell. Dysregulation of glucagon secretion may impact the glycemic control and overall
      pathogenesis in those with type 1 diabetes. The use of CGM technology in this study will
      allow us to determine the rapidity, consistency, and sustainability of any response to
      liraglutide.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is an improvement in progression-free
      survival (length of time during and after treatment in which a patient is living with a
      disease that does not get worse) when siltuximab is added to VELCADE and dexamethasone in
      subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
    ",A Phase 3 Study of Siltuximab or Placebo in Combination With Velcade and Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma,Multiple Myeloma,"['Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms, Plasma Cell']","
      This is a research study with an experimental drug called siltuximab (also known as CNTO
      328). Siltuximab is being developed to see if it may be useful in treating multiple myeloma,
      including multiple myeloma that has returned after (relapsed) or did not respond (refractory)
      to previous treatment. Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone
      marrow. The cancer cells in the bone marrow can cause the normal bone marrow cells to
      breakdown. This can result in low levels of red blood cells (which may make the patient feel
      tired or fatigued), low levels of white blood cells (which may increase the patient's chances
      of infections) or low levels of platelets (which may increase risk of bleeding). The cancer
      cells can cause damage to the normal bone. This can cause bone pain, bone fractures, and can
      increase the level of calcium in the blood. The cancer cells also make proteins (called
      M-proteins), which can result in damage to other organs, especially the kidneys. Siltuximab
      is a chimeric (part mouse and part human) antibody (immunoglobulin that is important for
      fighting infection). Siltuximab blocks another small protein called Interleukin 6 (IL-6). The
      body makes IL-6 naturally, and at normal levels it is important for the inflammatory
      response. But high levels of IL-6 can help cancer cells grow and interfere with chemotherapy
      drugs killing cancer cells. Cancer-related sicknesses such as weight loss, bone weakening,
      and depression have been linked to high levels of IL-6. This study tests the effectiveness
      and safety of siltuximab when it is taken together with Velcade and dexamethasone. There are
      two treatment groups, Arm A and Arm B. To try to make sure the groups are similar, patients
      will be put into Arm A or Arm B, randomly (by chance), like flipping a coin. Patients in Arm
      A will receive siltuximab plus Velcade and dexamethasone. Patients in Arm B will receive
      placebo plus Velcade and dexamethasone. About 500 patients will participate in the study.
      Velcade, also known as bortezomib, is injected directly into the vein all at once. This is
      called an intravenous (IV) push. Siltuximab or placebo is given as a 1 hour IV infusion
      through a small tube that goes directly into the vein. Dexamethasone is given orally. The
      treatment period is divided into cycles lasting about 21 days which will last until the
      patient's multiple myeloma gets worse, side effects that are not acceptable happen or when
      the patient decides to withdraw consent for treatment, whichever occurs first. Siltuximab
      11mg/kg or placebo will be given on Day 1 of every cycle. Velcade 1.3 mg/m2 will be given on
      Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 for Cycles 1-8, and on Days 1 and 8 for Cycles 9 and higher.
      Dexamethasone 20 mg will be given on the day of and the day after each Velcade dose. Safety
      assessments will be performed throughout the study and include obtaining and evaluating
      laboratory tests, vital signs (e.g. blood pressure), and checking the occurrence and severity
      of adverse events. Disease assessments will also be performed and include obtaining and
      evaluating blood and 24 hour urine samples, bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy samples and
      clinical and radiologic evaluations. After treatment, patients will enter the follow-up
      period, which includes visits up to 12 weeks after the last dose and checks every three
      months until death or the end of the study. Patients who stop treatment before their multiple
      myeloma gets worse will have disease assessments until their disease gets worse, they start a
      new multiple myeloma treatment, they decide to withdraw consent for study participation or
      the end of the study, whichever happens first. Siltuximab or placebo plus Velcade and
      dexamethasone will be given in 21-day treatment cycles until worsening of disease
      (progression), unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent for treatment, whichever comes
      first. Siltuximab 11 mg/kg or placebo will be given on Day 1 of every cycle. Velcade 1.3
      mg/m2 will be given on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 for Cycles 1-8, and on Days 1 and 8 for Cycles 9
      and higher. Dexamethasone 20 mg will be given on the day of and the day after each Velcade
      dose.

      Corneal abrasions are associated with significant discomfort during a 24-48 hrs healing
      phase. Current practice guidelines discourage the use of topical anesthetics in treating
      these patients due to concerns that these medications may prevent proper corneal epithelial
      healing. These concerns are based primarily on decades old animal based research. However,
      recent evidence suggests topical anaesthetics are a safe and effective way of managing
      patient pain in the short term. This study will investigate the effect of topical 0.5%
      tetracaine on corneal healing and pain management in patients with corneal abrasions in the
      first 48 hours.

      This will be a prospective, double blind, randomized, controlled study of 260 adults with
      uncomplicated acute corneal injuries presenting to the tertiary acute care settings in
      Kingston. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 0.5% tetracaine or saline in
      addition to usual care as outpatients. They will be followed through the ophthalmology
      emergency eye clinic to assess healing at 36-48hrs. after the acute care visit. The primary
      outcome will be an assessment of pain as measured every 4 hours for 48 hrs. using a 10mm
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes will include assessments of corneal healing,
      use of adjunct pain medications, time lost from work/usual activities, quality of sleep,
      ability to read and the SF12 quality of life questionnaire.

      This study will better inform the safety and effectiveness of short-term tetracaine usage in
      patients with simple corneal abrasions for optimal treatment of patients in the future.
    ",Effect of Tetracaine on Pain Management and Corneal Healing in Patients With Acute Corneal Abrasion,Corneal Abrasion,Corneal Injuries,"
      Corneal abrasions are commonly encountered eye injuries presenting to acute care settings and
      account for over 10% of new ophthalmological presentations at eye accident departments,
      primary care offices, and emergency departments. Patients complain of severe eye pain,
      foreign body sensation, pain with blinking, and photophobia. Corneal abrasions are defects in
      the epithelial layer that occur secondary to mechanical ocular surface trauma. Common causes
      of corneal abrasions include fingernail injuries, tree branches, and projectile pieces of
      metal, wood, or glass that injure or become embedded in the cornea. . Though associated with
      significant discomfort, the prognosis for simple corneal abrasions is usually excellent, with
      full recovery within 24-48 hours. Untreated abrasions, particularly those associated with a
      retained foreign body, can lead to complications such as corneal ulcers, prolonged pain, and
      visual acuity loss.

      Currently, the standard approach to treating corneal abrasions includes removal of the
      foreign body if present, oral analgesics for pain control, and topical antibiotics.
      Traditional guidelines by ophthalmologists have advocated against the use of topical
      anesthetics due to concerns with corneal epithelial healing the potential for patients to
      miss important clinical clues that indicate the rare development of secondary corneal
      infection, as well as the potential for longer term misuse leading to severe corneal
      ulceration and perforation. Previous studies, primarily using animal models, have found a
      delay in corneal epithelial healing with topical anaesthetics, particularly with repeated and
      prolonged usage. Several case studies have described impaired corneal epithelial healing and
      ulceration with the prolonged use and abuse of topical anesthetic drops (0.05% proparacaine
      HCl). There have been reports of topical anesthetic (TA) induced corneal damage including
      punctate epitheliopathy, corneal lysis, perforation, persistent epithelial defects, and
      ocular inflammation. It is thought that local anesthetics inhibit mitosis and cellular
      migration, preventing proper re-epithelialization of the cornea.

      However, in recent years a number of randomized clinical trials and case studies of human
      subjects have shown that with appropriate application and restricted short term usage,
      topical anesthetics did not delay wound healing or increase risks of corneal ulceration.

      A recent prospective, randomized, double-blind trial looked at the effect of topical
      anesthetics on epithelial healing and pain management for patients with uncomplicated corneal
      abrasion. The study included 116 patients presenting to the emergency department who were
      given either 1% tetracaine HCl or control artificial tears. The study found no change in
      corneal healing rate or persistent symptoms but little benefit in pain relief as measured at
      48 hrs. A previous prospective randomized study comparing 0.05% proparacaine and placebo has
      shown a significant decrease in reported pain with topical anesthetic use compared to control
      with no change in corneal healing. Another study evaluating the effect of 1% tetracaine for
      pain management after photorefractive keratectomy also reported significant pain reduction
      with topical anesthetic use with no delays in epithelial healing.

      Controversy continues to exist over the utility of topical anesthetics in managing pain and
      their safety in affecting corneal healing. Contemporary studies of short term topical
      anesthetic use, noted above, have not shown adverse effects on healing. Differential effects
      on pain management have been found. Yet the investigators believe the Waldman study measured
      pain at a delayed time when the abrasion would be expected to have healed. Clinicians in
      Queen's Department of Emergency Medicine do not generally prescribe topical anesthetics for
      corneal abrasions and believe that evidence demonstrating their efficacy and safety would
      change practice patterns for the benefit of patients with these injuries and those in other
      centres. The investigators also hope that this study will better address problems of
      inadequate participant enrollment and retention that previous studies have encountered.

      1.3 - Research Question In adult emergency department patients with acute corneal abrasions,
      is the application of 0.5% tetracaine effective in the short-term management of pain while
      not being associated with adverse effects on healing?

      1.4 - Hypothesis Based on the review of existing literature on the effects of topical
      anesthetics, the investigators hypothesize that short-term and controlled usage of tetracaine
      will be an effective way in managing patient pain and will not affect corneal healing.

      Data from some studies indicate the decline in the effectiveness of the authorized COVID-19
      vaccines due to antibody waning following vaccination and the emergence of different
      variants. These findings support the need to increase vaccination and booster campaigns to
      protect the adult population against infection. Valneva developed the VLA2001 vaccine, a
      highly purified, whole virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine produced on Vero cells and inactivated with
      β-propiolactone. VLA2001 will be adjuvanted with the licensed adjuvant cytosine
      phospho-guanine (CpG) 1018 (produced by Dynavax, contained in HEPLISAV-B®) in combination
      with aluminum hydroxide. On April 14, 2022, VLA2001 was granted Conditional Marketing
      Authorization (CMA) by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the
      United Kingdom for primary immunization in adults 18 to 50 years of age. This follows the
      emergency use authorization granted by the Bahraini NHRA in March 2022. As a substantial
      population has received a primary vaccination series with authorized vaccines, a booster dose
      to extend the duration and protection may be required.This study aims to investigate the
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the VLA2001 vaccine as a booster dose to adults
      18 years and older who were primed with another licensed inactivated COVID-19 vaccine at

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of D-cycloserine and glycine for treating
      negative symptoms (such as loss of interest, loss of energy, loss of warmth, and loss of
      humor) which occur between phases of positive symptoms (marked by hallucinations, delusions,
      and thought confusions) in schizophrenics.

      Clozapine is currently the most effective treatment for negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
      Two other drugs, D-cycloserine and glycine, are being investigated as new treatments.
      D-cycloserine improves negative symptoms when added to some drugs, but may worsen these
      symptoms when given with clozapine. Glycine also improves negative symptoms and may still be
      able to improve these symptoms when given with clozapine. This study gives either
      D-cycloserine or glycine (or an inactive placebo) with clozapine to determine which is the
      best combination.

      Patients will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 will receive D-cycloserine plus
      clozapine. Group 2 will receive glycine plus clozapine. Group 3 will receive an inactive
      placebo plus clozapine. Patients will receive these medications for 8 weeks. Negative
      symptoms of schizophrenia will be monitored through the Scale for the Assessment of Negative
      Symptoms, Positive symptoms will be monitored through the Positive and Negative Syndrome
      Scale, and additionally subjects will complete the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the
      Global Assessment Scale.

      An individual may be eligible for this study if he/she is 18 to 65 years old and has been
      diagnosed with schizophrenia.
    ",Glycine and D-Cycloserine in Schizophrenia,Schizophrenia,Schizophrenia,"
      To determine if glycine produces improvement in negative symptoms and D-cycloserine produces
      worsening in symptoms compared to placebo, patients will undergo a double blind study of
      d-cycloserine and glycine treatment added to clozapine.

      Clozapine is more effective for negative symptoms of schizophrenia than conventional
      neuroleptics, but the neurochemical actions contributing to this superior clinical efficacy
      remain unclear. Recent evidence points to a role for glutamatergic dysregulation in
      schizophrenia, as well as important differences between conventional agents and clozapine in
      effects upon glutamatergic systems. D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine
      modulatory site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, improves negative symptoms when
      added to conventional agents and worsens negative symptoms when added to clozapine. High-dose
      glycine also improves negative symptoms and has provided preliminary evidence suggesting that
      glycine improves negative symptoms when added to clozapine. Serum concentrations of glycine
      predicted response to both high-dose glycine and D-cycloserine. Both clozapine and
      D-cycloserine may improve negative symptoms by activation of the glycine modulatory site of
      the NMDA receptor complex. Because D-cycloserine is a partial agonist, it may act as an
      antagonist at the glycine site in the presence of clozapine, whereas the full agonist,
      glycine, would not be expected to worsen negative symptoms in the presence of clozapine.

      This study proposes to administer a fixed-dose of D-cycloserine, glycine, or placebo added to
      clozapine in 45 patients with schizophrenia. Because assessments are standardized between
      studies, results from this study can be compared with results from a previous study of
      D-cycloserine added to conventional neuroleptic.

      The study was ultimately suspended before participants were enrolled, due to definitive
      findings indicating that pairing treatment of D-cycloserine with Clozapine resulted in
      worsening of negative symptoms.

      Clarithromycin may be an effective therapy in Crohn's disease. It is a broad spectrum
      antibiotic. Crohn's disease, the investigators think, is in some way related to bacteria,
      which reside in the bowel.

      Previous studies of different types of antibiotic in Crohn's disease have shown encouraging
      results. Clarithromycin alters the bacteria in the bowel and gets into cells in the bowel
      which may contain bacteria. There is some evidence that clarithromycin can stimulate the
      immune system and improve the function of cells involved in killing bacteria in the bowel.
    ",Clarithromycin in Active Crohn's Disease,Crohn's Disease,Crohn Disease,"
      WHAT IS THE PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED ?

      Lack of effective cure for Crohn's disease.

      Effective symptomatic treatment of Crohn's disease can be achieved in approximately 60-80%
      using corticosteroids [1] with a similar response to enteral or intravenous feeding. The
      benefit is usually short-term however, with more than 50% relapsing within a year [2] and
      over 90% of patients with ileocaecal disease eventually requiring at least one surgical
      operation [3].

      The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown but it is commonly believed to be due in some way to
      bacteria: either as an unusual response to the normal intestinal flora or possibly to a
      specific infection such as an atypical bacterium. It is typified histologically by the
      presence of granulomata (in over 75% of cases) and closely resembles intestinal tuberculosis,
      radiologically and histologically. A search for Mycobacteria has produced conflicting results
      with one centre claiming that Mycobacterium paratuberculosis DNA can be detected in the
      majority of cases [4] but with others finding Mycobacterial DNA in only about 10% [5].
      Studies have shown that a variety of organisms including normal intestinal bacteria and
      yeasts can be grown from Crohn's disease mesenteric lymph nodes and that the lymphocytes
      within these lymph nodes are manufacturing antibodies that are directed against a broad range
      of bacterial antigens so it is a more widely held view that a wide range of micro-organisms
      invade the mucosa in Crohn's disease, possibly as a result of a breakdown in the normal
      mucosal barrier [6].

      WHAT IS THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED?

      That clarithromycin may be an effective therapy in Crohn's disease. It is a broad spectrum
      antibiotic that has particularly good penetration into macrophages [7] and may therefore be
      effective at eradicating the organisms at the centre of the granulomatous reaction in Crohn's
      disease. There is also some evidence suggesting that macrolide antibiotics can stimulate
      macrophage proliferation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis and cytocidal activitity [8].

      WHY IS A TRIAL NEEDED NOW?

      Open label studies have shown promising results with Clarithromycin. A study published in
      abstract by Present's group in New York reported a response in 7/12 (58%) whose Crohn's
      disease activity index (CDAI) fell by a mean of 130 points (range 79-130) in response to
      clarithromycin 500 mg bd for 6 weeks [9].

      HAS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW BEEN CARRIED OUT AND WHAT WERE THE FINDINGS?

      A Medline search for "" clarithromycin and Crohn's disease"" yields only three responses. The
      first is the report of an open-label study of a combination of clarithromycin 250 mg bd (or
      azithromycin in 3 patients) and rifabutin 450 mg per day given for a mean of 18 months to 52
      patients by the St George's Hospital group who are the major protagonists of the
      Mycobacterium paratuberculosis hypothesis [10] . They report a response in terms of
      ""significant fall in Harvey Bradshaw Index"" in 93% but CDAI was not reported and many of the
      patients seem to have had rather modest elevations of Harvey Bradshaw index on entry. Ten of
      the patients also received a quinolone antibiotic and a further 5 received clofazimine. The
      other two are reports of clarithromycin in Mycobacterium haemophilum infection including at
      least one in a case of apparent Crohn's disease. Review of American Gastroenterological
      Association abstracts for the past three years yielded reference [9] and an Australian study
      of a triple therapy regimen for Mycobacteria that consisted of rifabutin 450 mg per day,
      clarithromycin 750 mg per day, clofazimine 2 mg per kg. Twelve patients were treated for 8-12
      months and 10/12 achieved ""near complete control"" [11].

      HOW WILL THE RESULTS OF THIS TRIAL BE USED? This trial will establish whether clarithromycin
      is effective in achieving remission in Crohn's disease and would be a significant advance in
      non-steroid treatment of active Crohn's disease. If a significant positive result is observed
      then further trials of prolonged treatment would be indicated to assess clarithromycin's
      effect on the prevention of relapse.

      WHAT ARE THE PLANNED TRIAL INTERVENTIONS? Patients will receive either (i) Clarithromycin S/R
      1g od or (ii) placebo tablets of identical size, colour and taste.

      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED DURATION OF THE TREATMENT PERIOD? Clarithromycin or placebo therapy will
      continue for three months.

      WILL HEALTH SERVICE RESEARCH ISSUES BE ADDRESSED? Not Applicable

      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED FREQUENCY/DURATION OF FOLLOW UP? Patients will be reviewed after one,
      two and four weeks and then monthly for the following two months of treatment. Follow up
      thereafter will then be in the gastroenterology outpatient clinics.

      HOW WILL THE OUTCOME MEASURES BE MEASURED AT FOLLOW-UP? CDAI will be calculated at baseline
      and at each subsequent follow up from the patient's symptom scoring diary, haematocrit and
      weight. Similarly the van Hees index will be calculated and serum CRP measured. The IBD
      quality of life questionnaire will be completed at baseline and at 3 months.

      Patients will also have a diary card to record the details of any other symptoms noted during
      the trial to assess adverse effects of the trial treatment.

      WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR ALLOCATING PATIENTS TO TRIAL GROUPS?
      Randomisation will be allocated by the pharmacy department of the hospital.

      WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED METHODS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST OTHER SOURCES OF BIAS? Controls (known
      only to the Pharmacy Department) will receive placebo tablets which are identical in size
      colour and taste. Patients will be stratified according to site of disease into 3 groups:
      colonic CD only, perianal disease only and others (ileocolonic, small bowel only).

      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED SAMPLE SIZE? 39 patients in each group (active treatment and placebo)
      gives a 90% power of excluding a response of 60% (p2) compared to 20% (p1) for placebo at
      p<0.05 [16]. The published placebo response rate in active CD being 20%.

      WHAT IS THE PLANNED RECRUITMENT RATE? 5 patients per month

      ARE THERE LIKELY TO BE ANY PROBLEMS WITH COMPLIANCE? Compliance will be assessed by the
      number of returned tablets and assessed as good (<25% returned, fair 25-50% returned and poor
      (>50% returned).

      WHAT IS THE LIKELY RATE OF LOSS TO FOLLOW UP? 100% follow up should be achievable.

      HOW MANY CENTRES WILL BE INVOLVED? One

      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED TYPE OF ANALYSIS? For the primary outcome measure the difference in
      proportions will be calculated with associated 95% confidence intervals. Formal hypothesis
      testing of the primary outcome will then be compared by chi-square test.

      Quantitative variables will be compared using repeated measures analysis taking into account
      the distribution of each variable [17]

      WHAT IS THE PROPOSED FREQUENCY OF ANALYSIS? Once only on completion.

      ARE THERE ANY PLANNED SUBGROUP ANALYSES? Data from patients in each stratified group will be
      examined separately but formal statistical analysis between the subgroups will use a test for
      interaction (Altman DG. Practical Statistics for Medical Research. Chapman & Hall. London.
      1991). We anticipate though, that the main outcome data will be presented for all the
      patients together.

      WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED RESEARCH COST OF THE TRIAL? To be discussed. Part funding will be
      required for research nurse and drug trials pharmacist.

      IS THERE AN NHS SERVICE SUPPORT COST OF THIS TRIAL, AND IF SO WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED COST? The
      only NHS cost would be modest, involving only the routine testing of full blood count and CRP
      which is current practice in the monitoring of patients with relapses of inflammatory bowel
      disease.

      OVER WHAT PERIOD IS FUNDING REQUESTED? Funding is requested for a 2 year period to cover the
      primary trial.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill
      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving fludarabine together with rituximab
      may kill more cancer cells. Sometimes the cancer may not need treatment until it progresses.
      In this case, observation may be sufficient. It is not yet known whether giving fludarabine
      together with rituximab early is more effective than giving fludarabine and rituximab after
      observation in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying fludarabine and rituximab to compare how
      well they work when given early or after observation in treating patients with previously
      untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if early treatment with chemoimmunotherapy comprising fludarabine phosphate
           and rituximab extends the time to second treatment in patients with genetically
           high-risk (unmutated IgV_H), asymptomatic, previously untreated chronic lymphocytic
           leukemia (CLL).

        -  To determine the time to disease progression that would warrant second treatment.

        -  To determine overall survival.

      Secondary

        -  To measure the proportion of patients with asymptomatic, previously untreated CLL who
           have mutated and unmutated IgV_H genes.

        -  To determine the differences in acute and chronic toxicity of administering
           chemoimmunotherapy early to patients with genetically high-risk CLL compared to waiting
           until symptoms develop.

        -  To determine the effect of select pretreatment clinical and biological characteristics
           (such as interphase cytogenetic abnormalities, ZAP-70 expression, and p53 dysfunction
           [primary and secondary]) on response, time to second treatment, and overall survival of
           patients with genetically high-risk CLL randomized to early treatment.

        -  To determine the effect of select pretreatment clinical and biological characteristics
           (such as interphase cytogenetic abnormalities, ZAP-70 expression, and p53 dysfunction)
           on response, time to first and second treatments, and overall survival of patients with
           genetically high-risk CLL randomized to standard treatment (observation until symptoms
           occur).

        -  To describe the natural history of patients with genetically low-risk (mutated IgV_H
           genes), asymptomatic, previously untreated CLL, in terms of time to initial treatment,
           response, progression, and survival.

        -  To determine the effect of select pretreatment characteristics on time to first
           treatment, response, progression, and survival of patients with genetically low-risk
           CLL.

        -  To correlate patterns of resistance that emerge in patients with unmutated IgV_H genes
           who have relapsing or refractory CLL following receipt of chemoimmunotherapy with clonal
           evolution, including acquisition of high-risk karyotype abnormalities, p53 mutations,
           p53 dysfunction (primary and secondary), altered mRNA and protein expression related to
           treatment resistance, DNA mutations, microRNA gene expression, and methylation changes.

        -  To determine whether highly sensitive flow cytometry negativity at completion of therapy
           in patients randomized to early treatment is an effective surrogate marker for prolonged
           time to second treatment, overall survival, and other clinical benefits.

        -  To collect demographic data on familial CLL in newly diagnosed patients participating on
           this study.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Genetically high-risk disease: Patients are stratified according to age (< 50 years vs
           50 to 70 years vs > 70 years) and presence of the high-risk genetic feature
           [del(11)(q22.3) or del(17)(p13.1)] by FISH (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of
           2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive rituximab IV over 4 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 of week 1 and
                then on day 1 of weeks 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Patients also receive fludarabine
                phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 of weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. After
                completion of chemoimmunotherapy, patients are followed every 3 months until
                disease progression. At the time of disease progression, patients receive
                retreatment with chemoimmunotherapy as above or another treatment regimen.

             -  Arm II: Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression. At the time
                of disease progression, patients receive rituximab and fludarabine phosphate as in
                arm I. Patients are then followed every 3 months until second disease progression.
                Patients with a second disease progression receive retreatment with
                chemoimmunotherapy as above or another treatment regimen.

        -  Genetically low-risk disease: Patients are followed every 3 months until disease
           progression. At the time of disease progression, patients receive rituximab and
           fludarabine phosphate as in arm I. Patients are then followed every 3 months until
           second disease progression. Patients with a second disease progression receive
           retreatment with chemoimmunotherapy as above or another treatment regimen.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative studies.

      After finishing treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      The study will be a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial, and the investigators plan
      to enroll premature infants <32 weeks, <1500g, and who are < 21 days of age at Regional One
      Health, LeBonheur Children's Hospital, and Methodist Germantown NICUs in Memphis, TN. A study
      group of 42 patients for each group will be needed to allow a maximum difference of 25% to
      consider non-inferiority in the closure rate between IV acetaminophen and IV indomethacin
      (with power of 80% and alpha of 0.05).2 The investigators' goal will be to enroll 50 infants
      for each treatment group, to help with an expected 20% drop out rate either due to
      complications or parents removal of consent. Dosages: IV acetaminophen 15mg/kg/dose every 6
      hours for 12 doses,6 IV indomethacin dose will depend on age.IV indomethacin will be given
      every 12 hours for 3 doses. The infants will be eligible for the study after primary
      attending has made the decision to treat the hsPDA. The goal will be 50 infants in the IV
      acetaminophen group and 50 infants in the IV indomethacin group.

      Informed consent will be obtained from the parent after ECHO has been obtained and the
      primary attending has decided to treat PDA in the infant who meets inclusion criteria without
      any of the exclusion criteria. The investigators will use block randomization and stratify by
      site to generate 140 random values of either 0 for acetaminophen or 1 for indomethacin. The
      goal will be 50 infants randomized to acetaminophen group and 50 infants randomized to
      indomethacin group. The numbers will be placed in opaque envelope and opened after consent is
      obtained. The primary team will not be blinded given the different frequencies of
      administration of acetaminophen and indomethacin. The first ECHO will be read by staff
      pediatric cardiologist. A pediatric cardiologist will retrospectively go back and read all
      ECHOs blinded for standardization.

      Prior to induction of treatment, we will record complete blood count (CBC) and complete
      metabolic panel (CMP) with AST/ALT. After treatment, the investigators will record AST/ALT
      within 48 hours, and will record follow-up ECHO reports that occur within seven days of
      initiation of treatment. The decision to repeat treatment will be left to primary attending's
      discretion. The primary attending will determine any additional medical or surgical treatment
      if indicated. Data regarding ROP, IVH, and BPD will be collected from patient's chart prior
      to discharge.

      Primary outcome will be the rate of successful PDA treatment by ECHO in each group.
      Successful PDA treatment will be defined as no longer meeting ECHO criteria for hsPDA.
      Secondary outcome data will be recorded and include the following: retreatment, surgical
      closure, days on invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of supplemental oxygen
      requirement, respiratory support at 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA), NEC, ROP, days to full

      This project (funded by the IWT-TBM program) will organize a randomized placebo-controlled
      multicenter intervention trial in 500 COPD patients to study the effectiveness and safety of
      azithromycin therapy in the acute setting of COPD exacerbations requiring hospital admission.
      Although long-term use of azithromycin is proven effective to prevent exacerbations, inherent
      risks outweigh the benefits. By reducing the dose and duration of the azithromycin treatment
      and by restricting the treatment to acute periods with highest risk for treatment failure,
      benefits may counterbalance potential side effects, which may result in a new treatment
      strategy for these acute events.

      The present study is designed by the services of respiratory medicine of the Leuven and Ghent
      University hospitals but will run in total in 17 different large hospitals in Belgium, of
      which 12 are located in Flanders.

      Purpose :To compare the efficacy and and safety of the P-Gemox chemotherapy regimen with
      those of the EPOCH regimen for stage IE to IIE ENKTL.
    ",Efficacy and Safety Study of P-Gemox vs.EPOCH as First-line Chemotherapy to Treat NK/T-cell Lymphoma With Early Stage,"Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell","['Lymphoma', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell']","
      ENKTL is an aggressive type of NHL characterized by poor survival, for which the optimal
      treatment strategies have not been fully defined. Radiation therapy (RT) is widely
      administered for patients with localized nasal disease, and produces a complete response (CR)
      rate of up to 70%.However, local and systemic failures are observed frequently in patients
      who receive RT alone.Therefore, chemotherapy is needed in combination with RT to reduce the
      risk of recurrence. Unfortunately, ENKTL shows a poor response to the CHOP chemotherapy
      regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) . EPOCH (etoposide,
      vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and prednisone) chemotherapy followed by involved
      field radiotherapy (IFRT) results in a CR rate of 75.0%. Recently, a chemotherapy regimen
      including gemcitabine,oxaliplatin and l-asparaginase (GELOX) has emerged, with promising
      results.Since 2003, a proportion of patients newly diagnosed with ENKTL were treated with the
      EPOCH chemotherapy regimen at some hospitals in China. From 2008, many hospitals in the
      southern part of China began to use the GELOX( Pegaspargase is used instead of
      l-asparaginase,P-Gemox).Our multicenter retrospective study showed the GELOX regimen produces
      a better long outcome with less toxicity than the EPOCH regimen for patients with early stage
      ENKTL.However,further prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the
      conclusion.

                on day 5 and prednisone (60 mg/m 2 /day) 60 mg/m 2 /day on days 1-5.The treatment
                cycle is repeated every 21 days.

      After at least two cycles of chemotherapy, patients who have achieved stable disease (SD)
      following two cycles, partial response (PR) after four cycles or complete response (CR) after
      six cycles of chemotherapy are referred to primary IFRT.

      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional GI disorder in which abdominal
      pain and/or discomfort is associated with changes in bowel habit, and with features of
      disordered defecation. IBS affects 10-20% of the population and causes a marked reduction of
      quality of life in affected individuals.The high prevalence of IBS is accompanied by large
      societal economic burdens and negative effects on the quality of life in affected patients.
      It is divided into 3 types IBS-D diarrhea predominant, IBS-C constipation predominant, IBS-M

      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional GI disorder affecting 10-20% of
      the population and causing a marked reduction of quality of life in affected individuals. An
      altered brain-gut axis has been accepted as a main pathogenetic mechanism of IBS, which is
      associated with a dysfunction of the GI autonomic nervous system. These alterations may lead
      to abnormal visceral hypersensitivity and aberrations of gut motility. Recently, additional
      potential mechanisms of IBS have emerged including alteration of gut microbiota and low-grade
      inflammation/immune activation. These factors might lead to abnormal motility and visceral
      hypersensitivity and contribute to the symptoms. Naïve gut microbiota plays important roles
      in the maintenance of gut homeostasis by direct bactericidal effects and the evolution of
      both innate and adaptive immune systems. Gut microbiota is thought to play important roles in
      the pathogenesis of IBS. This is evident from the fact that IBS occurs more frequently after
      intestinal infection or antibiotics treatment. Studies have shown that the alterations of the
      intestinal microbiota are observed in IBS patients.Considering the relationship between
      alteration of gut microbiota and inflammation of gut, manipulation of gut microbiota by
      probiotics appears to be an ideal treatment modality for IBS. However, the beneficial effects
      and efficacy of altering gut microbiota by probiotics to improve the symptoms of IBS have not
      been consistent in clinical trials and therefore it remains uncertain as an effective
      treatment.

      Sirukumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) immunoglobulin G1-kappa with a high
      affinity and specificity for binding to the human IL-6 molecule that may have therapeutic
      benefit in the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) by interruption of multiple pathogenic
      pathways. Sirukumab inhibits IL-6-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
      (STAT3) phosphorylation, resulting in the inhibition of the biological effect of IL-6. This
      study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sirukumab to characterize the benefit-to-risk
      profile of sirukumab in the treatment of active GCA. The study will be conducted in 2
      distinct parts (Part A and Part B) and consists of the following phases: Screening phase,
      Part A: 52-week double-blind treatment phase, Part B: 104-week extension phase with the
      option to receive open-label sirukumab based on disease status and a 16-week follow-up phase
      if applicable.

      Approximately 204 subjects with a diagnosis of GCA and active disease within 6 weeks of
      baseline will be randomized into Part A, the 52-week double-blind treatment phase, to receive
      one of two doses of sirukumab or placebo, each in addition to a pre-specified prednisone
      taper. The efficacy and safety of sirukumab in sustaining remission will be assessed at Week
      52. Subjects completing Part A of the study will be eligible to enter Part B, the 104-week
      extension phase, designed to investigate the long-term maintenance of remission and safety
      following cessation of sirukumab treatment and to assess long-term corticosteroid use.
      Subjects with active GCA at the end of Part A or those with new onset of GCA flare during the
      first 52 weeks of Part B will be eligible to receive open-label sirukumab. Subjects will need
      to have follow-up safety evaluations for at least 16 weeks after receiving the last dose of
      study drug, applicable only for those who are withdrawn prematurely from the study or whose
      open-label sirukumab treatment in Part B completes after Week 88.

      The combination lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) is an active treatment for
      Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients, both at diagnosis and at relapse.

      Pomalidomide, is an immunomodulatory molecule (IMID), derivative of thalidomide, developed to
      improve the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of the parent molecule. Pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone (pom-dex) proved to be an effective and safe treatment in MM patients
      refractory to lenalidomide and refractory/intolerant to bortezomib.

      The addition of chemotherapy to novel drugs has been evaluated both at diagnosis and at
      relapse. The combination of pomalidomide-cyclophosphamide-prednisone proved to be safe and
      effective in relapsed/refractory MM patients. The combination
      pomalidomide-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone (pom-cyclo-dex) was tested in a phase II study in
      patients with relapsed and refractory MM, demonstrating a good tolerability using
      pomalidomide at the dose of 4 mg. Pom-cyclo-dex resulted in a superior response rate and
      Progression-Free Survival (PFS) compared to pom-dex. The increased hematologic toxicities, as
      a result of the addition of oral cyclophosphamide, were manageable. With an overall response
      rate of 65% the combination demonstrated a promising efficacy.The first aim of our trial, is
      to compare the combination of pom-cyclo-dex vs pom-dex.

      Relapsed myeloma is defined as previously treated myeloma that progresses and requires the
      initiation of salvage therapy.

      According to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) recommendation, biochemical relapse
      is defined as an increase of ≥ 25% of tumor burden from lowest value, without any CRAB
      feature (CRAB is defined as the onset of clinical symptoms: hypercalcemia, renal failure,
      anemia and bone lesions) and detected in 2 consecutive determinations.

      Clinical relapse requires one or more direct indicators of progressive disease and end organ
      dysfunction (CRAB features).

      Treatment at relapse should start in case of clinical relapse or a significant paraprotein
      increase (doubling of M-component in 2 months).

      In case of biochemical relapse the standard is observation only, as in case of asymptomatic
      MM at diagnosis.

      However, a recently published trial, showed improved PFS and OS for newly diagnosed
      asymptomatic patients treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in comparison with
      observation only. Our hypothesis is that similarly, in the relapse setting, patients may
      benefit from an early intervention, meaning a treatment at biochemical relapse and not only
      in case of clinical relapse or rapid increase of M-component.

      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplastic disease of older adults, with a higher incidence in
      elderly patients: 26% are aged 65-74 years, and 37% are older than 75 years. The annual
      prevalence of MM is approximately 31 cases per 100,000 people in patients aged 65-74 years,
      and it increases to 46 cases per 100,000 people in patients aged ≥75 years. The prevalence of
      myeloma is likely to increase due to the extended survival and the growing life expectancy of
      the general population.

      Recently, the introduction of novel agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide
      and bortezomib, has changed the treatment paradigm of MM and extended survival.

      The prognosis of patients who are refractory to novel agents is especially poor. A
      retrospective study has recently demonstrated that patients with relapsed MM, who were
      refractory to bortezomib and were relapsed following, refractory to or ineligible to receive
      treatment with an IMiD, had a median overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) of 9
      and 5 months, respectively.

      STUDY DESIGN When patients experience biochemical relapse during lenalidomide maintenance,
      they will stop lenalidomide, as established in the related experimental protocol. Afterwards,
      patients can be considered for the enrollment in the present study if all inclusion and
      exclusion criteria are met.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label phase III study designed to assess the safety
      and the efficacy of two different pomalidomide combinations as salvage treatment in multiple
      myeloma (MM) patients.

      Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to 3 study periods: pre-treatment,
      treatment and long-term follow-up (LTFU).

      The pre-treatment period includes screening visits, performed at study entry. After providing
      written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be evaluated for study
      eligibility. The screening period includes the availability of inclusion criteria described
      above.

      The treatment period includes administration of pomalidomide and dexamethasone in arm A and
      pomalidomide combined with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in arm B. The response will be
      assessed after each cycle. Patients will be randomized to receive treatment at biochemical
      relapse (ARM I) or at clinical relapse (ARM II).

      The LTFU periods will start after development of confirmed progression disease (PD), all
      patients are to be followed for survival during the LTFU period every 3 months via telephone
      or office visit.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take telaprevir 3 times
      a day. You will take RVB by mouth 2 times a day. You will receive PEGIFN alfa-2a by an
      injection under the skin 1 time a week.

      Study Visits:

      On the first day you take the study drug:

        -  You will have an eye exam performed by the study doctor.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood
           pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check for the hepatitis
           virus.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking or side effects you may be having.

      Every Week while you are on study:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check for the hepatitis
           C virus. If part of the blood sample is left over after the Hepatitis C testing, it will
           be stored in the laboratory as a back-up sample, in case the original samples get lost.
           This sample may also be used to check if the Hepatitis C virus has become resistant to
           the study drug. No extra blood will be drawn for this storage.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you are taking or side effects you may be having.

        -  At Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 42, urine will be collected to check for infection and any
           other side effects to the drugs.

      If you can become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test every 4 weeks

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue receiving the antiviral therapy for up to 48 weeks, as long as the doctor
      thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the
      disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      Beginning the day after you stop taking antiviral therapy (or the day of transplantation,
      whichever comes first), you will have up to 24 weeks of follow-up testing performed. About 4
      and 20 weeks after your last dose:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if dMMR and/or POLE exonuclease domain mutant stage
      III colon cancer patients gain clinical benefit (i.e. improvement in disease free and overall
      survival) from PD-L1 inhibitors after standard fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1. This removes the
      suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumour CD8+ T cells, resulting in the restoration of
      cytotoxic T cell response.

      The rationale of giving Avelumab after standard adjuvant chemotherapy to this well-defined,
      molecularly-selected, group is based on the fact that dMMR and POLE exonuclease domain mutant
      CRCs have a highly and ultra-mutated genetic profile, respectively, thus leading to a high
      number of neo-antigens with associated over expression of immune checkpoint related proteins.
      This profile is expected to be highly responsive to checkpoint inhibition as suggested by
      data of PD-1 inhibitors in dMMR/MSI-H metastatic CRCs.

      If this study meets the primary endpoint, using Avelumab in the adjuvant setting following
      standard chemotherapy would become the standard of care for patients with dMMR and/or POLE
      exonuclease domain mutant colon cancers. Furthermore, given the availability of molecular
      markers for patient selection, funders of healthcare would be more likely to fund this
      treatment.

      This study also provides a unique opportunity to conduct translational research analyses on
      pre- and post-treatment tumour tissue samples and blood samples from dMMR or POLE mutant CRC
      patients treated with the checkpoint inhibitor Avelumab.

      This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, phase III trial comparing standard
      fluoropyrimidine based adjuvant chemotherapy followed by Avelumab (experimental arm) with
      standard fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy alone (control arm) in patients who
      have undergone radical surgical resection for stage III dMMR or POLE exonuclease domain
      mutant colon cancer. Patients will be stratified in a 1:1 ratio for dMMR status, POLE
      mutation and type of adjuvant chemotherapy (i.e., 24 weeks of single agent capecitabine
      chemotherapy versus 12 weeks of CAPOX chemotherapy).

      According to the statistical design, 402 patients (201 per arm) are to be randomised. It is
      expected that approximately 4000 participants will need to be screened in order to recruit
      402 patients to the study, assuming an incidence of dMMR of 10-15% and an incidence of POLE
      mutations of 7% in under 50s (unpublished data from Tomlinson group). Considering the time
      required to obtain local approval and to initiate all participating centres, the study is
      expected to take up to 36 months to complete accrual.

      There are no proscriptive criteria for surgical resection of the primary tumour in this
      trial. It is however expected that resection of the tumour will be undertaken in the elective
      setting by a colorectal specialist surgeon.

      Tumour MMR status will be routinely tested locally as per NICE guidelines (either in the
      pre-operative biopsy or resection specimen). Subjects whose tumours are dMMR can sign the
      main study consent and undergo the study screening procedures. If they are found to fulfil
      all eligibility criteria, then they will be randomised. Subjects who are below 50 and whose
      tumours are pMMR, will be asked to sign a prescreening consent for the centralised analysis
      of POLE exonuclease domain mutations. This will be done at Oxford Molecular Diagnostics
      Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford. Those who have tumours harbouring these
      mutations can sign the main study consent and undergo the study screening procedures. If they
      are found to fulfil all eligibility criteria, then they will be randomised.

      All eligible patients who are randomised will receive standard fluoropyrimidine-based
      adjuvant chemotherapy for 12 or 24 weeks depending on the decision of the local investigator.
      The choice of adjuvant chemotherapy (i.e., 24 weeks of single agent fluoropyrimidine
      chemotherapy or 12 weeks of doublet, oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy) must be declared by the
      investigator at study entry before randomisation. Type of adjuvant chemotherapy (i.e., 24
      weeks of single agent capecitabine or 12 weeks of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin). will be
      used as stratification factor alongside MMR status and POLE mutation.

      At the end of adjuvant chemotherapy, patients who are randomised to the investigational arm,
      will receive additional 24 weeks of treatment with Avelumab.

      After completion of treatment, all subjects will be followed up for up to 7 years from the
      start of adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Correlative biomarker analyses will be conducted as part of the translational study in tumour
      tissue samples from the resection specimens, tumour tissue samples from the relapsed tumour
      (if applicable, feasible and upon patient consent) and serial blood samples collected at
      study entry, during adjuvant treatment and follow-up.

      Severe sepsis and septic shock are life threatening medical emergencies and are among the
      most significant challenges in critical care. Case reports and case series suggest that
      plasma-derived protein C concentrate may improve the outcome of patients with acquired
      protein C deficiency. Evidence has accumulated on the clinical relevance of the PC pathway in
      modulating overwhelming inflammation and preventing coagulation derangements, two key
      mediators of organ damage, and thus of mortality and morbidity, in sepsis. The experience
      collected through these studies shows that PC is safe, in that it is not associated with
      bleeding or severe allergic complications,and possibly useful, at least to improve the
      coagulation abnormalities brought about by sepsis. Unfortunately, however, all we know comes
      from case series or case reports or an underpowered randomized controlled study. A randomized
      clinical trial, adequately powered for mortality or clinically relevant outcome, is necessary
      to confirm PC efficacy.The aim of this study is to demonstrate that Protein C zymogen has
      clinically relevant implications in terms of reduction of thromboembolic events, 30 days
      mortality, length of intensive care and hospital stay, time on mechanical ventilation, length
      of ICU and hospital stay. The study will also confirm that there is no bleeding concern with
      the use of Protein C concentrates.The study drug will be administered in the Intensive Care
      Unit for 72 hours and the patients observed till ICU discharge. Telephone followup will be
      performed at 30 days and at one year.

      Recently, growing body of evidence support the finding that anemia frequently occurs in
      patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well, is highly
      prevalent among heart failure patients, and both anemia and CKD are independently associated
      with increased mortality. A vicious circle is established with CHF causing both chronic renal
      insufficiency and anemia, and CKD further aggravating anemia which, in turn, worsens CHF and
      so on. Treatment of the anemia breaks this circle and improves the quality of life, cardiac
      and renal functions in patients with severe CHF.

      Intravenous iron alone was proved to allow the maintenance of target hematocrit in one-third
      of chronic renal failure predialysis patients.

      Based on these considerations, intravenous iron for anemia in patients with CHF and moderate
      CKD would represent a reasonable therapeutic approach.

      The aim of the trial is to assess the efficiency of intravenous iron therapy in the
      management of mild to moderate anemia associated with CHF NYHA III class and concomitant
      moderate CKD.
    ",Intravenous Iron in Patients With Severe Chronic Heart Failure and Chronic Kidney Disease,"['Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Chronic Heart Failure', 'Anemia']","['Kidney Diseases', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic', 'Heart Failure', 'Anemia']","
      Intravenous iron administration in CHF patients with absolute or functional iron deficiency
      could correct their anemia, thus improving cardiac function judged by ejection fraction and
      NYHA functional class. If true, enhancement of cardiac output will increase oxygen delivery
      to tissues, including renal cortex. This might improve the renal functions and slow the rate
      of progression of CKD reflected by the slope of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

      Since erythropoietin synthesis is located in peritubular fibroblasts from outer renal cortex,
      which is the most affected area during chronic hypoxia, increasing renal blood flow after
      anemia correction is expected to restore optimal erythropoietin production and normalize
      plasma Epo levels.

      The primary objective is to assess the efficiency of intravenous iron therapy in the
      management of mild to moderate anemia associated with chronic heart failure NYHA III class
      and concomitant moderate chronic kidney disease.

      The secondary objectives are to determine if the correction of anemia in these patients
      affects the cardiac function, the rate of progression of CKD and the plasma erythropoietin
      levels.

      The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration from Helsinki and Tokyo, with
      the amendments from Venice (1983), after the approval by the local ethics committee.

      The total observation period will be of 28 weeks, with a pre-study phase (selection,
      randomization of subjects) 4 weeks.The study period will last 24 weeks, with a possible
      extension to 48 weeks, depending on the results of this first phase.

      200 anemic patients with chronic heart failure class NYHA III and concomitant stage 3 chronic
      kidney disease will be enrolled, after obtaining their written informed consent.

      All patients will be evaluated for the inclusion and exclusion criteria at enrollment and at
      each visit during the pre-study phase. Only patients fulfilling all the requested criteria at
      all evaluation moments will be enrolled. The enrolled subjects will be centrally randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio into two study groups.

      Group I (treatment group): Subjects assigned to this group will receive intravenous iron
      (ferric sucrose product Venofer® 2%, 5mL/ampoule) in a starting dose of 200mg (2 ampoules)
      diluted in 150mL 0.9% NaCl solution, over 60 minutes, once a week for the first four
      administrations, and then every other week until hemoglobin levels reach 12g/dL. Then, iron
      dose will be adjusted to 1 ampoule at 2-4 weeks interval, as needed to maintain these levels
      with serum ferritin ≤500ng/mL.

      Iron administration will be discontinued if serum ferritin will exceed 500ng/mL, and will be
      restarted with a reduced dosage (1 ampoule at every 2-4 weeks) once serum ferritin decrease
      below this value.

      Conventional treatment for CHF will be continued as needed. Group II (control group):
      Subjects assigned to this group will continue their conventional treatment for CHF as needed,
      without iron supplementation.

      No other anti-anemic medication will be administered in either group during the study period.

      Subject's visits will take place at two weeks intervals in the first 12 weeks of the study
      phase and at 4 weeks apart thereafter. At each visit will be recorded, according to the
      schedule, data concerning physical examination, including signs of CHF, hematological and
      iron status, renal function, concomitant medication and adverse events.

      Parameters recorded at the time of first iron administration will serve as baseline
      determination.

      The completion of the study will be declared when 200 subjects will complete the whole
      observation period, according to the above protocol.

      This randomized phase III trial is studying gemcitabine and bevacizumab to see how well they
      work compared to gemcitabine alone in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as
      bevacizumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances
      to them without harming normal cells. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by
      stopping blood flow to the tumor. Combining gemcitabine with bevacizumab may kill more tumor
      cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine is more effective with or without bevacizumab
      in treating pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and bevacizumab achieves
      superior survival compared to gemcitabine and placebo in patients with previously untreated
      advanced pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the objective response rates, duration of response, progression free survival,
      and toxicity of these two regimens in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

      II. To measure baseline levels of VEGF and correlate with treatment outcome. III. To measure
      baseline and on treatment levels of additional growth factors that may be co- or counter-
      regulated with VEGF and correlate with response to treatment.

      IV. To measure baseline and on treatment levels of coagulation and endothelial cell
      activation markers that may predict for thrombotic or bleeding risks related to treatment.

      V. To generate protein expression profiles using a MALDI-TOF based platform from serum
      samples. To analyze and compare protein expression profiles to elucidate ion peaks that
      differentiate patients who respond to therapy from patients who do not respond. To identify
      proteins responsible for the differentially expressed ion peaks. To develop quantitative
      assays for each of these proteins.

      VI. To assess any differences in overall survival within the treatment arm (gemcitabine +
      bevacizumab), between the two VEGF genotypic groups: Group 1 denoted by individuals with CT
      or TT genotypes and Group 2 consisting of individuals with CC genotypes.

      VII. To conduct an exploratory analysis of gene-toxicity, gene-response, and gene-survival
      relationships for the various polymorphisms described in the genes implicated in gemcitabine
      pharmacology (CDA, DCK, DCTD, SLC29A1, SLC28A1, SLC29A2). An exploratory quantitative
      interaction between the genotypes (group 1 or 2) and the treatment arms (gemcitabine +
      bevacizumab or gemcitabine + placebo) in predicting overall survival will also be evaluated.

      VIII. To identify specific SNPs and genetic variation that are associated with differences
      among patients in the risk of toxicity.

      IX. To compare the effects of gemcitabine + bevacizumab versus gemcitabine + placebo on
      resource utilization, cost, and utilities, and if applicable, to make estimates of marginal
      cost-utility.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), disease extent (metastatic vs
      locally advanced), and prior radiotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab
      IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV as in arm I and placebo IV over 30-90 minutes on days
      1 and 15.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 590 patients (295 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 26.8 months.

      Number of subjects

      Two hundred (200) patients will be enrolled. All patients will be implanted with the SonRtip
      bipolar atrial lead and a LivaNova (Sorin) CRT-D device offering both SonR optimization
      algorithm and atrio-biventricular pacing. Patients will be assigned to either the treatment
      or control arms, employing a 1:1 randomization with up to 100 patients in each of the 2
      groups: Study Group (SonR CRT Optimization programmed ""AV+VV"") and Control Group (""Fixed
      Settings"" (FS), defined as a sensed AV delay of 125 ms, VV delay of 0 ms (simultaneous); SonR
      CRT Optimization programmed ""Off""). After the first 6 months, patients will be crossed-over
      to the alternative arm for another 6 months. There will be no washout period.

      Duration of the clinical investigation

      The study inclusion phase is expected to last approximately 1.5 years.

      Follow-ups

      Patients will be evaluated at baseline and randomized prior to implantation to SonR
      optimization or FS. A further clinical assessment, ECG and echocardiography will be
      undertaken at 6 months. At this point, patients will be crossed over to the other arm for
      another 6 months. The study closes following a further clinical and echocardiographic
      assessment at 12 months.

      Osteoporosis, a condition in which bones are fragile and break easily, is a major health
      problem for postmenopausal women. Research studies have shown that both estrogen/progestin
      replacement therapy (hormone replacement therapy, or HRT) and alendronate are effective in
      preventing and treating osteoporosis. However, because these drugs work in somewhat different
      ways, a combination of the two drugs might protect women from osteoporosis better than either
      drug alone. In this study we will test whether HRT and alendronate given together for 3.5
      years to postmenopausal women with low bone mass will have a greater effect on bone than
      either HRT or alendronate given alone. We will also give every participant in this study
      calcium and vitamin D supplements.
    ",Low-Dose Hormone Replacement Therapy and Alendronate for Osteoporosis,"['Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis']","['Osteoporosis', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic']","
      Clinical trials of estrogen/progestin replacement therapy (HRT) and a bisphosphonate,
      alendronate (ALN), have demonstrated that both are effective in causing gains in bone mass
      and preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women. The FDA has approved both
      these drugs for prevention and treatment of fractures, and both are widely used in clinical
      practice. Because both are approved and effective, and they work by different mechanisms,
      many patients and their physicians ask whether both should be taken in combination,
      particularly in cases of severe disease. The question is asked frequently because of the high
      incidence of osteoporosis among women and the need for long-term prevention and treatments
      that often last decades.

      Indeed, physicians are using ALN and HRT together without adequate scientific support for the
      assumption that the combination is more effective than either given alone.

      Clinical trials are now underway to test conventional doses of HRT given as conjugated equine
      estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg/day or its equivalent, combined with ALN, 10 mg/day. However,
      researchers are not studying the bone-sparing effectiveness of the combined administration of
      ALN and low-dose continuous HRT given as CEE, 0.3 mg/d, along with medroxyprogesterone, 2.5
      mg/d (MP). This low-dose continuous HRT regimen is attractive because of better convenience,
      better patient tolerance, and reduced risk of breast cancer and other safety concerns
      associated with conventional higher doses. Further, we have recently demonstrated that the
      bone-sparing effect of this regimen is comparable to that of higher doses.

      The long-term objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the combined therapy
      shows a greater bone effect than does either treatment given alone. Our specific aim is to
      conduct a 3.5 year, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of low-dose, continuous HRT
      combined with alendronate, 10 mg/d (ALN), in three groups (72 people per group) of
      estrogen-deprived postmenopausal women over age 60. We will give Group 1 low-dose HRT, Group
      2 ALN, and Group 3 both low-dose HRT and ALN. We will give calcium and vitamin D supplements
      to people in all three groups.

      The primary outcome measures will be spine bone mineral density (SpBMD) and total hip bone
      mineral density (HipBMD) measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Secondary
      outcome measures will be total body bone mineral content and forearm bone mineral content. In
      addition, we will perform studies to characterize the mechanism of the effects of these
      regimens. These studies will consist of measurements of urinary bone resorption markers,
      serum bone formation markers, calcium excretion, calcium absorption, and application of a
      model developed in our laboratory to estimate and compare the magnitudes of the anabolic
      effects (if any) of all three interventions on SpBMD and HipBMD.

      We have reported data showing that both agents have an anabolic effect on bone in humans,
      meaning that they cause an increase in bone mass beyond that explained by a remodeling
      transient brought about by reduction in bone remodeling rates. Further, research has shown
      that HRT and ALN affect bone by different mechanisms. Thus, this combination may have an
      additive effect on bone resulting in bone gain beyond that previously seen with other
      interventions. This project will provide much-needed information to physicians and their
      patients on the benefits and safety of this combination regimen so that they can make
      ""evidence-based"" decisions on the choice of interventions to prevent and treat osteoporosis.

      First study to test the validity of the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which

      Cotrimoxazole may improve the clinical course of the disease through eradication of
      Pneumocystis jiroveci colonization and other mechanisms as inhibiting the activation of
      alveolar macrophages and producing alterations in the surfactant system which favours the

      The ultimate goal of this work is to establish a method for control bleeding after
      tonsillectomy in awake children. Treatment of post-tonsillectomy bleeding in children
      typically requires general anesthesia with currently used electrocautery techniques.
      Micropolysaccharide hemosphere technology is a unique absorbable agent that helps clot form.
      These hemospheres consist of 100% purified plant starch that enhances natural clotting by
      concentrating blood solids such as platelets, red blood cells, and blood proteins on the
      particle surfaces to form a gelled matrix. This device provides painless, non-irritating
      control of bleeding, and has been used effectively for control of nosebleeds in awake adult
      patients. This device, however, has not been tested in the tonsillar fossae in children;
      thus, this study is performed to determine if at least 50% of children with bleeding
      tonsillar fossae can be spared rescue treatment with electrocautery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligibility is contingent on the presence of following characteristics:

          1. Children and adolescents age 5-18 years old. The lower age range is chosen in order to
             spare younger, smaller children who have less circulating volume to decrease any
             potential unwarranted risks of increased bleeding. The upper age range is chosen
             because our ultimate focus is to determine whether this therapy can help the pediatric
             population prevent the need for electrocautery under anesthesia for tonsil-related
             bleeding.

          2. Obstructive sleep disorder symptomatology requiring surgical intervention. The
             presence of obstructive sleep disorder is determined according to the practice of the

             history, physical exam findings, nasopharyngoscopy, lateral x-ray, sleep videotape, or
             polysomnography. In addition, the mean survey score on the OSD-6 (which is an
             instrument validated in children with obstructive sleep disorder (See Figure 2)) is at
             least 3, which corresponds to a moderate degree of symptoms (0 no symptoms, 6 symptoms
             could not be worse).

          3. Tonsillar or adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Tonsillar hypertrophy is defined as at least
             3+ tonsillar hypertrophy on a scale of 1+ to 4+, with the following definition of
             grades of obstruction determined by visual inspection: 1+ 0-25%, 2+ 26-50%, 3+ 51-75%,
             4+ 76-100%.

          4. Bilateral microdebrider tonsillotomy. This method of surgery is chosen because it (1)
             is a standard technique utilized by the surgeons involved in this study as treatment
             of obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy and (2) results in a relatively uniform,
             reproducible bleeding surface that requires hemostasis following tonsil removal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Eligibility is contingent on the absence of following characteristics:

          1. Personal or family history of bleeding diathesis or easy bruising. The introduction of
             this confounder should be avoided, given that the primary outcome is adequacy of
             hemostasis. Given that preoperative laboratory evaluation in the setting of no
             suggestive history has been shown to have low predictive values for successful
             perioperative hemostasis, enrolled subjects receive no preoperative laboratory
             screening.

          2. Intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs within 14 days prior to surgery.
             Although there are several trials that suggest that postoperative administration of
             these drugs may have no impact on hemorrhage, the topic remains controversial due to
             the large numbers of subjects required to achieve adequate power in such studies.
             Thus, the introduction of this potential confounder is avoided, given that the primary
             outcome is adequacy of hemostasis.

          3. Liver dysfunction. This disease state may also confound evaluation of hemostasis.

          4. Cardiac, renal, or blood pressure disorder. These states may make children less

          5. Chronic inflammation states, such as recurrent pharyngitis, may result in an increased
             propensity toward bleeding, and thus subjects with this potential confounder are
             excluded. Children with 3 or more acute pharyngitis episodes within the past year are
             excluded. A pharyngitis episode is defined as documentation by physician of the
             episode and >1 of the following: oral >38.3 degrees C, lymphadenopathy >2cm or tender
             lymphadenopathy, tonsil/pharyngeal exudates, group A beta hemolytic streptococcus
             positive, or antibiotic administration for proved/suspected streptococcal infection.

          6. Implant contraindications to the use of monopolar electrocautery. Metal implants would
             preclude safe randomization to the electrocautery treatment arm. There are no
             suspected or known contraindications to application of MPH at the tonsillar fossae.

          7. Allergic or adverse reactions to requisite perioperative medications. The current
             protocol calls for the use of an antibiotic and narcotic pain medication in all
             subjects, with one second-line agent as a planned alternative. Thus, inability to
             tolerate both penicillin and macrolide antibiotics, or both oxycodone and codeine
             narcotics, precludes entry into the trial.

          8. Children whose caregivers cannot commit to the 2 week follow up schedule. This
             schedule includes daily calls to evaluate bleeding and pain control.

          9. Cognitive inability to report bleeding, adverse events, or pain control. Thus,
             children with mental retardation, communication disorders, developmental delay, and
             chronic pain states are also excluded.

      The treatment of lupus nephritis with cyclophosphamide and steroids changed the prognosis of
      lupus nephritis in the early '80s. In recent years, alternative regimens have appeared in
      both the induction and maintenance with similar results at least to those offered by the
      classic pattern and possibly with fewer side effects, especially for long term. The
      association of prednison and mycophenolate has created large expectations to that effect, and
      is part of first-line therapeutic arsenal of lupus nephritis type III, IV and V.

      Despite the significant advances that have led to these treatments, the likelihood of
      complete remission after six months remains, according to the series of 8-13% and partial
      remission do not exceed 60% in papers published. In the last year, two articles have been
      published supporting the use of triple therapy (prednisone, mycophenolate, cyclosporine) in
      poor prognosis of lupus nephritis with hopefully better results than those obtained
      previously. In this study we try to compare the effectiveness of triple therapy, the therapy
      is now considered standard (prednisone, mycophenolate) in patients with lupus nephritis type

      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is an interest to optimize HF (heart
      failure) management in patients over 80 years old. The primary objective is to assess the
      effect of HF (heart failure) optimized management (guidelines of the European society of
      Cardiology (ESC) on Quality of Life (QOL) in aged over 80 year's old at 6 months.
    ",Is There a Benefit to Optimize Heart Failure (HF) Treatment in Aged Over 80 Year's Old Patients?,Heart Failure,Heart Failure,"
      Aging population, and better management of various heart diseases including ischemic explain
      the growing up of incidence and prevalence of chronic heart failure. The aging of the
      population leads now to support services in cardiology and particularly in the units of heart
      failure in subjects over 80 years. It's a special population with several co-morbidities, in
      whom it is difficult to introduce all the recommended treatments with optimal doses. There is
      indeed a significant difference between the optimal doses of treatments tested in studies on
      heart failure and doses found on the orders of inpatients for HF (heart failure).
      Unfortunately clinical trials on heart failure have recruited young patients, mean age 65
      years. Clinical studies in cardiology and particularly in heart failure recruit young
      subjects at the expense of seniors who are underrepresented in these studies.

      The investigators will compare two groups: the first one with an ""optimized"" management and
      the second one as ""usual care"".

      The primary endpoint will evaluate the quality of life at 6 months according to the scale of
      Minnesota. Secondary outcomes will be the quality of life at 12 months, quality of life
      measured by the SF 12 (to check what level is most suited to this population) at baseline, 6
      months and one year, mortality at 12 months, the number of re-hospitalization and
      cardiovascular events at 12 months, New York Health Association (NYHA) class (at baseline, 6
      months and 12 months) and walking test for 6 minutes (at baseline, 6 months and 12 months).
      Finally the investigators plan to conduct an analysis on the medical and economic interest of
      this support.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, prednisone, and atrasentan work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor
      cells. It is not yet known whether docetaxel, prednisone, and atrasentan are more effective
      than docetaxel and prednisone in treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying docetaxel, prednisone, and atrasentan to
      see how well they work compared to docetaxel and prednisone in treating patients with stage
      IV prostate cancer and bone metastases that did not respond to previous hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the survival and progression-free survival of patients with hormone-refractory
           stage IV prostate cancer and bone metastases treated with docetaxel and prednisone
           combined with either atrasentan vs placebo.

      Secondary

        -  Compare pain progression of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life, in terms of palliation of metastatic bone pain and
           improvement in functional status, of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare objective response in patients with measurable disease treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine whether a 30% reduction in PSA and the slope of PSA from baseline to 3 months
           is a surrogate marker for survival in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate PSA progression with clinical progression and death in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to disease progression (measurable or non-measurable disease
      progression vs prostate-specific antigen progression only), use of bisphosphonates at study
      entry (yes vs no), worst pain, measured by the Brief Pain Inventory ""pain"" scale (< grade 4
      vs ≥ grade 4), and extraskeletal metastases (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive oral
           atrasentan and oral prednisone once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days
           for up to 12 courses. Patients with stable or responding disease after course 12 may
           register for continued oral atrasentan treatment for up to 52 weeks in the absence of
           disease progression* or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel and prednisone as in arm I. Patients also receive
           oral placebo once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeat every 21 days for up to 12
           courses. Patients with stable or responding disease after course 12 may register for
           continued oral placebo treatment for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease
           progression* or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients with PSA progression alone will be allowed to continue treatment

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before courses 4, 7, and 10, and then after
      completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for up to 3 years from study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 930 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the mood stabilizing and antipsychotic properties of
      quetiapine in the treatment of depression by comparing subjects who were randomly assigned to
      either quetiapine monotherapy, quetiapine and citalopram; or haloperidol and citalopram. We

      first generation antipsychotic plus an antidepressant for the treatment of a major depressive
      episode with psychosis.

      Thus, current practice for treating psychotic depression is to combine an antidepressant with
      an antipsychotic. However, there are limitations to this approach. The rate of response is
      still lower than in other forms of major depression (Janicak et al., 2001). The rate of
      noncompliance is higher in this group; and the incidence of adverse effects related to the
      antipsychotic is increased (Janicak et al., 2001). As a result, studies have examined
      alternative treatments. The present study proposes to examine quetiapine's antipsychotic and
      mood stabilizing properties for the treatment of a major depressive disorder with psychotic

      There is emerging evidence that patients with SARS-CoV-2 are affected by increased
      coagulopathy, including in the most advanced forms, a fully blown disseminated intravascular
      coagulation, leading to multi organ failure (MOF). Post-Morten observations from patients who
      died because of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Bergamo, Italy and other places have revealed the
      presence of diffuse venous, arterial and microcirculatorythrombosis, not only restricted to
      the lung but also involving the kidneys, heart and gut.

      Thrombin plays a central role in mediating clot forming as well as in mediating inflammation.
      A direct factor X inhibitor, namely edoxaban can act as prophylactic measure to mitigate the
      risk of venous and arterial thrombotic complications.

      Colchicine is an inexpensive (generic drug), orally administered, and a potent
      anti-inflammatory medication. It might accelerate SARS-CoV-2 clearance.

      The aim of the CONVINCE study is therefore to assess the safety and efficacy of edoxaban
      and/or colchicine administration in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who are managed outside the
      hospital with respect to the occurrence of fatalities, hospitalisation, major vascular
      thrombotic events or the SARS-CoV-2 clearance rate under RT PCR.

      The question being asked in this study is: Will patients with advanced pancreatic cancer live
      significantly longer if they are treated with a combination of Gemcitabine and ON 01910.Na
      than if they are treated with Gemcitabine alone? There are two parts to this study. In the
      first part of the study, patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who have received no
      prior chemotherapy for this disease will be assigned by chance either to the group that will
      be treated with both Gemcitabine and ON 01910.Na (about 100 patients will be in this group)
      or, to the group that will be treated with Gemcitabine only (about 50 patients will be in
      this group). How long patients survive in the 2 groups will be compared. If it looks like
      there is no difference between the groups, the study will stop. If it looks like patients in
      the group that were treated with both Gemcitabine and ON 01910.Na survive longer, the study
      will continue into a second part where more patients will be treated in order to confirm and
      better understand the findings of the first part of the study.

      This will be a Phase III study with sample size recalculation after 100 events have occurred.
      The study will be open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-center and will be conducted at
      approximately 200 to 300 study sites (60 to 80 study sites in the first portion of the
      trial).

      In the first portion of the study, a total of 150 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer
      who have received no prior chemotherapy for this disease will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion
      to 1 of the 2 following treatment regimens:

        -  Arm A: Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle + ON 01910.Na 1800
           mg/m2 via 2 hr continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) infusions administered twice weekly
           for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle (approximately 100 patients)

        -  Arm B: Gemcitabine only, 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle (approximately
           50 patients).

      Patients will be stratified at entry using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
      performance status (ECOG scores of 0 1 vs. ECOG scores of 2; patients with higher scores will
      not be enrolled).

      Patients will remain on study until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever
      comes first. Moreover, after treatment discontinuation for any cause, all patients will be
      followed until death.

      After 150 patients have been enrolled, accrual will pause and patients will be followed until
      100 deaths have occurred. At that time, the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will
      oversee a formal interim analysis to compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 groups and
      may recommend early stopping for futility. If the study continues after interim analysis,
      then the randomization scheme will continue up to 364 patients or the newly-calculated sample
      size. The maximum number of enrolled patients will be 650. The number of clinical sites may
      be expanded up to approximately 200 to 300 centers.

      Patients in the gemcitabine-only arm (Arm B) will not be allowed to cross over to the
      combined treatment arm (Arm A). In addition, no palliative radiotherapy will be allowed
      during the trial.

      The primary analysis will compare OS in the ON 01910.Na + gemcitabine arm (Arm A) vs.
      gemcitabine-only arm (Arm B) once an appropriate number of events has been reached. There are
      2 secondary efficacy outcomes: progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response.

      Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. Grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities and > Grade 2
      non-hematologic toxicities will be monitored.

      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether
      giving sorafenib tosylate together with doxorubicin hydrochloride is more effective than
      sorafenib tosylate alone in treating liver cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the overall survival (OS) of patients treated with sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate)
      and doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) to that of those treated with sorafenib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare time to progression (TTP) of patients treated with sorafenib and doxorubicin to
      that of those treated with sorafenib.

      II. Compare progression-free-survival (PFS) of patients treated with sorafenib and
      doxorubicin to that of those treated with sorafenib.

      III. Compare tumor response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria of patients treated with sorafenib and doxorubicin to that of those treated with
      sorafenib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1 and sorafenib
      tosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      After 6 courses, patients may continue to receive sorafenib tosylate PO QD or BID in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO QD or BID on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and

      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell
      therapy.

      This research study is evaluating if a patient-specific experimental therapy for metastatic
      melanoma will lengthen survival with minimal harmful effects. It is called an experimental
      therapy (or ""study therapy"") because it is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). This research study will use the patient's own tumor cells,the
      patient's own dendritic cells (a type of immune cell), and a granulocyte-macrophage colony
      stimulating factor (GM-CSF, a type of growth factor). GM-CSF is a natural growth factor that
      stimulates growth of white blood cells in the body. Since 1991, GM-CSF has been used as a
      standard treatment to help increase the number of white blood cells after chemotherapy.

      The patient's dendritic cells are grown in a test-tube with the patient's tumor cells and the
      growth factor. The resulting solution is called the study therapy. The intent of the study
      therapy is to make the dendritic cells more effective at fighting the tumor when they are
      injected back into the patient.

      Cognitive difficulties such as indecisiveness or inability to concentrate are core symptoms
      of depression with up to 90% of untreated depressed individuals experiencing these symptoms.
      As many as half of those who remit from a major depressive episode continue to experience
      residual cognitive deficits, but these symptoms are frequently overlooked in clinical
      practice. This leads to persistent cognitive deficits which can cause reduced level of
      functioning and loss of productivity. As standard antidepressants have an inadequate impact
      on these residual cognitive symptoms, further treatment options are required. Modafinil is a
      wakefulness agent with evidence that it improves some domains in cognition such as memory in
      those whose non-cognitive depressive symptoms have been treated over a short term period.
      This medication may have favourable lasting effects on cognition, such as the ability to plan
      and execute tasks in those who receive modafinil for a longer time period. The aim of this
      study is to investigate whether modafinil can enhance cognition and have additional effects
      on functioning and work productivity in a sample of participants who were treated for
      depression but who continue to experience cognitive deficits.
    ",Modafinil's Effects on Cognition in Remitted MDD,"['Major Depressive Disorder', 'Cognitive Impairment']","['Depressive Disorder', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Depressive Disorder, Major']","
      Background:

      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a chronic mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of
      5-20% (Kessler et al., 2003; Woo et al., 2016). While depressed mood and loss of interest in
      activities are core features of MDD, cognitive deficits such as indecisiveness and
      inattention are present and interfere with work and social functioning (McIntyre et al.,
      2013). These cognitive deficits frequently persist beyond remission from a Major Depressive
      Episode (MDE), with up to 94% of those impaired during an episode continuing to experience
      deficits after the episode (Bhalla et al., 2006), including deficits in attention, executive
      functioning, and psychomotor speed (Salagre et al., 2017). These residual cognitive symptoms
      often persist and are associated with poor functioning and loss of productivity (Lam et al.,
      2014).

      In a systematic review examining MDD patients in remission, multiple regression analyses
      found that MDD predicted lower performance on measures of attention, processing speed, and
      cognitive flexibility relative to healthy controls (HCs; Hasselbalch et al., 2011). Further
      evidence for the presence of neuropsychological deficits in remitted MDD patients comes from
      a systematic review and meta-analysis that found the remitted MDD patient group had executive
      function and attentional deficits, while symptomatic patients exhibited executive function,
      attentional, and memory deficits (Roc et al., 2013).

      Importantly, there are no medications with evidence to modify cognition in remitted
      depression. This suggests that in order to assist in the recovery of cognitive and functional
      abilities, additional novel treatment options are required.

      There is considerable evidence that subjective and objective measures of cognition are not
      well correlated in MDD. This has informed the investigators' choice of separate subjective
      and objective measures for this study. In addition, cognitive disturbances affect
      psychosocial function and quality of life across several areas, and this necessitated
      measurement of quality of life. In this study, the investigators will use a computerized
      version of the Central Nervous System (CNS) Vital Signs Cognitive Battery, which will provide
      a Neurocognitive Index score (NCI). The NCI is a global measure of cognitive functioning,
      averaging the scores from 7 tests over 5 domains: composite memory, psychomotor speed,
      reaction time, complex attention, and cognitive flexibility.

      Pilot results from the The Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND)-1
      study, involving treatment with escitalopram, have clearly documented the nature of deficits,
      and are in line with expectations in remitted depression. In this pilot sample of 208
      participants, 15% of participants had global cognitive impairment despite 8 weeks of
      antidepressant treatment and achievement of clinical remission (McInerney, personal
      communication).

      In an 8-week antidepressant study, those who significantly improved in global cognitive
      functioning (assessed using NCI) had superior functioning and work productivity relative to
      those who did not significantly improve (Hasselbalch et al., 2011). Vortioxetine is the only
      antidepressant with modest evidence for improving cognitive parameters during a depressive
      episode (Rock et al., 2013). Research into the use of psychostimulants as a treatment for
      cognitive deficits in depressed patients has led to the consideration of modafinil and
      methylphenidate as potential novel pharmacological treatments (Minzenberg et al., 2008).
      Modafinil is a well-tolerated wakefulness agent where only two clinical studies have
      previously examined its role on cognition in depression; one where currently depressed
      patients had improvements in one measure of executive function after 4 weeks of treatment as
      an adjuvant (DeBattista et al., 2004), and the other where there were improvements in memory
      after a single dose in depressed participants who achieved remission (Kaser et al., 2016).
      Unlike methylphenidate, modafinil appears to impact both ""hot"" (emotion-laden) and ""cold""
      (independent of emotion) cognitive deficits, which are commonly seen in remitted depression.

      Immediate effects of modafinil on cognition have been shown (Kaser et al., 2016) and the
      investigators will be the first to examine the pro-cognitive effects in a remitted depressed
      sample over 8 weeks. The dose of modafinil (200mg) used in the study, sample size, and
      randomized control trial (RCT) study design parallels those described in the immediate effect
      study, and this maintains continuity. However, the study does not examine whether the
      immediate effects are maintained. More importantly, it is unclear whether the cognitive
      improvements translate into improvement in functioning.

      The added focus on functional outcomes fits with patient-centered models of healthcare, as
      functional outcomes are of greatest importance to most patients. Thus, the RCT study and
      choice of outcome variables have been carefully designed with specific endpoints to delineate
      these aspects. Cognitive flexibility, memory, and attention will be domains of importance in
      this study, since these domains have been shown in previous literature to be improved by
      modafinil (Minzenberg et al., 2008; DeBattista et al., 2004; Kaser et al., 2016).

      Objectives, Hypotheses, and Impact:

      The primary objective of this study is to delineate the cognitive effects of modafinil in
      patients with remitted depression at baseline and 4 weeks, and monitor whether these effects
      are maintained with continual dosage over an 8-week period. The secondary objective of this
      study is to understand the effect of modafinil in patients with remitted depression on
      measures of functioning at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, and whether these effects parallel
      the cognitive changes.

      The investigators' overarching hypothesis is that specific aspects of cognitive functioning,
      including the domains of memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility, will improve through
      treatment with modafinil. The investigators hypothesize that participants with remitted
      depression who continue to experience cognitive deficits and are taking modafinil will have
      improvements in aspects of cognitive domains at 4 weeks, and these improvements will be
      sustained at 8 weeks. It is also hypothesized that functional improvements will parallel the
      improvements in cognitive domains.

      The study ensures a closer examination of modafinil's effect on individual facets of
      cognition in patients with remitted MDD. This enhanced understanding will enable the
      development of new treatment plans for residual cognitive symptoms, where none currently
      exist. Moreover, it could spur interest in new drug development programs to address an unmet
      need of targeting cognition across disorders where depression is a central feature (e.g.
      Bipolar Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder). Finally, the study would delineate the
      specific endophenotypes within cognition (e.g. working memory) and functional improvement
      (e.g. social functioning), which would lead to personalized treatment options based on the
      endophenotype profile.

      Methods In this randomized control trial, remitted MDD patients with residual cognitive
      deficits (n=50) will have cognitive symptoms and functioning evaluated before and after an
      8-week trial of modafinil 200mg or placebo. Participants will be recruited through the
      ongoing CAN-BIND 1 Wellness Study; the Depression Program at St. Michael's Hospital; the
      shared care network at St. Michael's Hospital; and referrals from residents, family doctors,
      and other St. Michael's psychiatrists. All participants who meet inclusion criteria will be
      asked to enrol in this study and provide written informed consent.

      Participants will be on a stable dose of an antidepressant for at least 6 months prior to
      enrolment. They will be required to remain on this stable dose for the duration (8 weeks) of
      the trial. They will be prescribed modafinil or placebo at a dose of 100 mg for the first
      week then 200mg for 7 weeks. After week 8, participants will be informed of which group they
      were in and if they were taking modafinil, they can choose to continue on modafinil or to
      discontinue.

      Participants will undergo an 8-week randomized, placebo controlled treatment trial of
      modafinil 200mg with a total of 3 study visits. Participants may require more clinical visits
      as needed. Screening will be done to confirm study eligibility. At the screening visit all
      participants will provide demographic data (age, gender, education, ethnicity, occupation,
      family history of mental illness), undergo a structured diagnostic assessment
      (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview), complete the CNS Vital Signs cognitive
      battery, and have the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale administered. At the baseline
      visit, participants will initiate the study drug trial, complete clinician rated and
      self-report scales, and complete the cognitive battery in CNS Vital Signs. Participants will
      start with a 100 mg dose at baseline, and increase to the 200 mg dose at week 1 if the drug
      is well tolerated. Participants will repeat all measures at week 4 and 8. Adverse events will
      be recorded at each study visit. For participants who wish to discontinue the study drug at
      week 8, they will first have their dose decreased to 100 mg for one week and attend an
      additional week 9 safety visit to evaluate adverse events before full discontinuation of the
      study drug.

      It is hypothesized that deficient or insufficient levels of vitamin D may play a role in the
      pathogenesis of depression and that supplemental vitamin D may have an antidepressant effect
      -either through a direct action on the brain or though correction of a deficiency state. The
      investigators hypothesize that eight weeks of vitamin D supplementation will produce a
      statistically significant decrease in symptoms of depression compared to placebo for people
      with non-remitted depression.

      This study will be a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Individuals will be
      recruited who have failed to achieve remission from a depressive episode after a minimum of
      eight weeks of treatment with a first-line antidepressant, at an adequate dose. They will be

      anti-depressant medication, which they will continue to take at the same dose for the
      duration of the eight week study.There will be an additional follow up visit one month later.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of supplemental vitamin D as an adjunctive
      treatment in the management of non-remitted depression compared to placebo. Additionally, its
      safety and tolerability will be assessed.

      Asthma is a common, chronic respiratory disease affecting 1-18 percent of the population. It
      is accepted that much of the uncontrolled asthma is due to poor adherence and asthma outcomes
      in such cases may improve simply by increasing adherence to available treatments.
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has developed a sensor, which clips on to the ELLIPTA® dry powder
      inhaler (DPI). This will inform subjects if/when they have taken their medication that is in
      the ELLIPTA inhaler, as well as other information, including: asthma management strategies,
      tracking of symptoms, asthma triggers, medication reminders and daily asthma forecasts. The
      sensors, application (app), and provider portal that provide data are subsequently described
      as the CIS. The combination of once-daily FF/UMEC/VI with the CIS will improve the disease
      management and adherence. Thus, this study is designed to study the effectiveness and
      adherence of single inhaler triple therapy (SITT) of FF/UMEC/VI with the CIS as compared to
      multiple inhaler triple therapy (MITT) of the combination of FP/SAL plus TIO without CIS in
      subjects with inadequately controlled asthma. The study randomization will be stratified by
      pre-study inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) dosage strength (mid- or high-dose). Subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either FF/UMEC/VI delivered via the ELLIPTA DPI with the
      CIS or FP/SAL delivered via the DISKUS® DPI (with sensor only) plus TIO delivered via the
      RESPIMAT inhaler (without sensor). The maximum study duration will be approximately 29 weeks,
      which comprised of prescreen/ screening/ randomization period of up to 4 weeks, 24-week
      treatment period and a 1-week follow-up period. Approximately 1006 subjects will be
      randomized in the study. ELLIPTA and DISKUS are registered trademarks of GlaxoSmithKline

      Dyslipidemias are a group of metabolic disorders produced by raised concentrations of
      lipoproteins, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is the lipoprotein that
      transports endogenous cholesterol from the liver to the peripheral tissues. Increased
      cholesterol and triglycerides levels lead to an increased risk of arteriosclerosis, which is
      the underlying cause of heart attack, strokes and peripheral vascular disease.

      Despite changes in lifestyle and the availability of potent lipid-lowering agents,
      cardiovascular disease continues to be the major cause of death in Western Europe and North
      America. Serum cholesterol levels exceeding 5 mmol/L (193 mg/dL) are common in adults in
      Britain and much of Europe, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of lapaquistat acetate taken with either
      torvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin or lovastatin (stable statin
      therapy) in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. Total participation time in this study is

      This multi-center prospective intervention study is designed to develop coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)
      supplementation as a cost-effective adjunctive therapy for burn injury. The long-term goals
      of this project are to establish the beneficial effects of CoQ10 on multiple organ
      dysfunction and on the clinical and functional outcomes of burn victims.
    ",Efficacy of Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation on Multi-Organ Dysfunction in Severely Burned Patients,Multiple Organ Failure,Multiple Organ Failure,"
      Burns represent one of the most excruciating and devastating battlefield injuries. Based on
      estimates reported in 2010, burn injuries account for 603,000 visits to US emergency
      departments and 50,000 hospital admissions each year. The annualized cost of these
      hospitalizations totals $1 billion. Despite recent advances in acute critical care, the
      damage that occurs to organs and systems (e.g., heart, liver, kidney, lung, and immune cells)
      in the sub-acute phase of severe burn injury remains a major challenge to achieving further
      reductions in mortality and improvements in the long-term clinical and functional outcomes of
      burn.

      The treatment proposed in this study targets the mitochondria, organelles that are crucial
      for the survival and function of every cell type within the body. Known as the power plants
      of cells, the mitochondria generate energy and also function as critical regulators of
      cellular life, death, and inflammation. Burn injury damages the mitochondria in cells close
      to and distant from the injury site. This, in turn, complicates the patient's critical
      illness by causing multiple organ dysfunction. The mitochondria, therefore, pose a plausible
      potential target to further improve the clinical outcome of burn patients. Nonetheless,
      therapies that target the mitochondria have not yet been studied in burn patients.

      CoQ10 is an essential nutrient that is vital to the function and integrity of the
      mitochondria. CoQ10 deficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunction and thereby induces
      dysfunction in multiple organs, including liver, heart, immune cells (i.e., white blood
      cells), brain, and muscle. In a pilot clinical study of CoQ10, we showed that burn injury
      causes CoQ10 deficiency, which is reversed by CoQ10 supplementation. In our preclinical study
      in mice, CoQ10 administration prevented mitochondrial damage, systemic inflammation, and
      metabolic dysfunction in burned animals, and improved survival and bacterial killing activity
      in animals with severe infection. Our data indicate that CoQ10 deficiency caused by burn
      injury may worsen the patient's clinical condition. Since CoQ10 supplementation is capable of
      reversing CoQ10 deficiency, which, in turn, may prevent mitochondrial damage and subsequent
      dysfunction of multiple organs, it is a plausible therapy for preventing mortality and
      promoting recovery in burn patients.

      Two hundred ninety eligible burn patients admitted to any of the 15 military and civilian
      hospitals participating in this study will be enrolled within 48 hours after severe burn
      injury and randomly assigned to either CoQ10 (n=150) or Placebo (n=150) group. The safety and
      the efficacy of CoQ10 on multiple organ dysfunction and death, length of hospital stay,
      mitochondrial damage, and muscle wasting will be studied in comparison with Placebo.

    ",Eslicarbazepine Acetate as Therapy in Diabetic Neuropathic Pain,Painful Diabetic Neuropathy,"['Neuralgia', 'Diabetic Neuropathies']","
      Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus.
      It currently affects about 1% of the population but its prevalence is expected to increase in
      coming years (European Medicines Agency 2007) in step with the increase in diabetes mellitus
      prevalence, which is expected to affect 220 million people by 2010

      The clinical development of ESL to treat neuropathic pain is based on its chemical and
      pharmacodynamic relationship to sodium channel blockers, including carbamazepine, which is
      effective for treating some neuropathic pain conditions. Preclinical data supports the
      theoretical background.

      This study will examine the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      Eslicarbazepine acetate for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain.

           therefore a reasonable choice.

        -  Dose of capecitabine and docetaxel should be reduced to 1800 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2 to
           improve tolerability without compromising efficacy.

      treatment (vancomycin/daptomycin) for hospitalised adults with Methicillin Resistant

      antibiotics (these are antibiotics from the penicillin family) to the standard therapy will
      lead to more efficient bacterial killing and hence lead to faster clearance of bacteria from
      the blood stream and other areas of infection, thereby reducing the risk of the spread of
      infection and death.

      The study design is an investigator-initiated, multi-centre, open-label, randomised
      controlled trial. This will include 440 participants diagnosed with Methicillin Resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia recruited over a period of 4 years (July 2015 - June 2019)
      from within Infectious Diseases inpatient units across 21 hospital sites including 18 from
      within Australia and 3 located in Singapore. Participation will be voluntary and subject to
      informed consent. The participants will be randomised 1:1 to either the standard therapy
      group or combination therapy group. The combination therapy will include a treatment of
      intravenous beta-lactam for the first 7 days of treatment, in addition to the standard
      treatment (either vancomycin or daptomycin). The primary outcome measure will be
      complication-free survival 90 days post randomisation.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and
      capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block
      tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving
      combination chemotherapy together with monoclonal antibodies before surgery may make the
      tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these
      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet
      known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without cetuximab in

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label study. Patients are
      stratified according to participating center and assigned chemotherapy regimen. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy:

             -  Arm I: Patients receive 1 of the following chemotherapy regimens:

                  -  OxMdG: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and oxaliplatin IV
                     over 2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously over
                     46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6
                     courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

                  -  CAPOX: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral
                     capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up
                     to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive 1 of the following regimens:

                  -  OxMdG + cetuximab: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on day 1 and
                     OxMdG chemotherapy as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6
                     courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

                  -  CAPOX + cetuximab: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8,
                     and 15 and CAPOX chemotherapy as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for
                     up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
                     toxicity.

        -  Surgery: Beginning 2-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients in both arms
           undergo liver resection.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning 4-8 weeks after completion of surgery, patients receive
           treatment (OxMdG or CAPOX with or without cetuximab) as in arm I or II of neoadjuvant
           therapy.

             -  Arm I: Treatment with OxMdG repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6 courses and treatment
                with CAPOX repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
                progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Arm II: Treatment with OxMdG + cetuximab repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6 courses
                and treatment with CAPOX + cetuximab repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in
                the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 12 weeks during chemotherapy, at completion of
      study treatment, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      Cost per life year and per quality-adjusted life year is assessed at baseline, every 12 weeks
      during treatment, and then at 3, 5, and 10 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      Everolimus will be given to patients with metastatic breast cancer who already has a progress
      taking Everolimus but with a change in the endocrine treatment.
    ",Everolimus Beyond Progress for Patients Who Had Progress Under Everolimus and Exemestane,Metastatic Breast Cancer,Breast Neoplasms,"
      With continuation of endocrine treatment of breast cancer an adaptive upregulation of
      different signaling cascades including the PI3K/akt/mTOR pathway results in cell growth
      stimulation and results in resistance to endocrine therapies. One way to restore endocrine
      sensitivity is the inhibition of the mTOR pathway in combination with endocrine therapy
      leading to an increase in PFS compared with endocrine therapy alone. Guidelines recommend the
      sequential treatment with different endocrine therapies. It therefore appears reasonable to
      explore if sensitivity can be restored by changing the subsequent endocrine combination
      partner of Everolimus in case of failure of a combined endocrine-everolimus therapy.

      Sirukumab is a human anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the cytokine
      with high affinity that may have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of polymyalgia
      rheumatica (PMR) by interrupting multiple pathogenic pathways. Sirukumab inhibits
      IL-6-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation,
      resulting in the inhibition of the biological effect of IL-6. This study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of sirukumab to characterize the benefit-to-risk profile of sirukumab in
      the treatment of active PMR. The study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part A and Part B) and
      consists of the following phases: Screening phase, Part A: 52-week double-blind treatment
      phase, Part B: 52-week extension phase with no study drug administration and a 16-week
      follow-up phase if applicable.

      Approximately 150 subjects with a diagnosis of PMR and active disease within 6 weeks of
      baseline will be randomized into Part A, the 52-week double-blind treatment phase, to receive
      one of two doses of sirukumab or placebo, each in addition to a pre-specified prednisone
      taper. The efficacy and safety of sirukumab in sustaining remission will be assessed at Week
      52. Subjects completing Part A of the study who are in clinical remission will be eligible to
      enter Part B, the 52-week extension phase, designed to investigate the long-term maintenance
      of remission and safety following cessation of sirukumab treatment and to assess long-term
      corticosteroid use. Subjects will need to have follow-up safety evaluations for at least 16
      weeks after receiving the last dose of study drug, applicable for those who have withdrawn
      prematurely from the study or who have completed Part A but are not eligible for Part B.

      In spite of the fact that the post-myocardial infarction survival rate has improved with
      recent medical advances, reduced heart function attributed to irreversible loss of viable
      cardiomyocytes is still a major clinical problem.

      The aim of the current study is to determine whether intramyocardial injection of autologous
      CD133+ bone marrow stem cells yields a functional benefit in addition to coronary artery
      bypass graft (CABG) surgery in patients with chronic ischemic coronary artery disease.
    ",Intramyocardial Transplantation of Bone Marrow Stem Cells in Addition to Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery,"['Myocardial Ischemia', 'Coronary Artery Disease']","['Coronary Artery Disease', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Ischemia']","
      Beginning in 2001, a phase-1 equivalent feasibility and safety evaluation of intramyocardial
      injection of autologous CD133+ bone marrow cells during elective CABG surgery was conducted
      at Rostock University. No procedure-related adverse events were observed and there was some
      improvement of myocardial contractility and perfusion. It was decided to proceed with a
      controlled efficacy testing, comparing the outcome of standard CABG surgery with that after
      CABG and CD133+ cell injection. The results of that study indicate that the additional cell
      injection yields a better left ventricular contractility than CABG alone (LVEF = 47.1±8% vs.
      41.3±9% at 6 months). Although this result is encouraging, the trial had several limitations
      that hamper interpretation of the data. Most notably, no sham-injection of placebo material
      was performed in the control group, and standard 2D echocardiography served as the only
      measurement of global LV contractility.

      However, there were no procedure-related complications up to 18 months postoperatively,
      especially no new ventricular arrhythmia or neoplasia.

      Therefore, a prospective, double blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled multi-center
      trial will be conducted in Germany, employing current state-of-the art measurement of global
      and regional LV contractility by cardiac MRI. The following hypothesis will be tested:
      ""Patients who undergo CABG & CD133+ cell injection do not have a higher LV ejection fraction
      than patient who undergo CABG alone, measured 6 months after the operation"". A power analysis
      based on the previous trial results indicated that 71 patients per group need to be enrolled
      so as to reject the null-hypothesis with sufficient statistical power. A total of 142
      patients will therefore be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to undergo CABG surgery in conjunction with either intramyocardial injection of autologous
      CD133-enriched bone marrow cells or placebo. Bone marrow will be harvested one or two days
      prior to surgery and a CD133-enriched cell product (or placebo) will be prepared at a central
      cell processing GMP unit. Bypass surgery will be performed and the investigational product
      will be injected in the border zone of the infarcted myocardium. Random allocation will be
      performed in the cell production facility, so that neither the patient nor the surgeon nor
      any of the personnel involved in follow-up examinations will know whether the cell product or
      placebo was administered. The primary outcome parameter (LVEF at 6 months) will be measured
      by cardiac MRI, and secondary outcome parameters include physical exercise capacity, cardiac
      function, safety and Quality of Life (QoL).

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a drug, porfimer sodium, and a light from a
      non heated laser. The activation of the drug is done by lighting of abnormal areas using a
      fiber optic device. The fiber optic device is a very fine fiber (like a fishing line) that
      permits transmission of light. The fiber optic device is inserted into a diffusing balloon
      device to ensure the good positioning of the fiber optic within the esophagus (food pipe). It
      is thought that the size and the flexibility of a new diffusing balloon device could improve
      the safety profile of the photodynamic treatment by reducing the risk of narrowing or closure
      of the food pipe (esophageal stenosis) sometimes occurring after treatment.

      This research study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PDT with porfimer sodium
      using a new diffusing balloon device for light application in the removal of high-grade
      dysplasia (HGD, precancerous change in the food pipe tissue) in Barrett's esophagus (BE).
      This study will provide advanced knowledge about phototoxicity (reaction similar to sunburn)
      and esophageal stenosis, main risks with this therapy. It will involve 75 patients with HGD
      in BE across North America and Europe and will last between 13 and 16 weeks. In addition,
      concentrations of porfimer sodium in the esophageal tissue will be analyzed in a subgroup of
      patients.

      difficulty in swallowing; electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, clinical laboratory testing,
      concomitant medication intake and other therapy uses will be collected.

      All patients will receive one course of PDT consisting of an intravenous injection of 2.0
      mg/kg of porfimer sodium over 3-5 minutes followed by one or two endoscopic laser light
      applications. The first laser light application will be performed within 40-50 hours using a
      new diffusing balloon catheter. The second laser light application (without a diffusing
      balloon catheter) will be performed within 96-120 hours on those areas showing an
      insufficient response to the first application. Follow-ups (Weeks 4 and 13) will include some
      or all of the following procedures: physical exam; vital signs evaluation; body weight;
      endoscopy; skin, degree of difficulty in swallowing and esophageal stenosis assessment; and

      therapy/procedure, and intake of concomitant medication. All patients will undergo rigorous
      systematic endoscopic biopsy surveillance at Week 13 (final visit).

      Tissue concentration of oligomers (component of porfimer sodium) in normal and abnormal
      esophageal tissues will be determined in a subgroup of 12 patients. These patients will
      provide esophageal tissue samples before the porfimer sodium injection and on four separate

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, cisplatin, fluorouracil, and
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy
      with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which regimen of
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy is most effective in treating head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV head
      and neck cancer.
    ",Combination Chemotherapy and Radiation in Treating Patients With Stage III or IV Head and Neck Cancer (Paradigm Trial),Head and Neck Cancer,Head and Neck Neoplasms,"
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare 3-year survival of patients with previously untreated stage III or IV squamous
           cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with induction chemotherapy comprising
           docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil followed by radiotherapy and carboplatin or
           docetaxel vs radiotherapy and cisplatin only.

      Secondary

        -  Compare 2-year progression-free status in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare 5-year survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare 3- and 5-year progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the complete response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare tumor site-specific survival in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare functional organ preservation in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate tissue and germline markers with response, local/regional control, and the
           development of distant metastases in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising docetaxel, cisplatin, and
           fluorouracil. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses. Patients achieving a
           pathologic complete response at the primary site and a clinical complete response in the
           neck then receive carboplatin once weekly and undergo concurrent radiotherapy once
           daily, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks. Patients with a partial response at the primary site
           (i.e., positive biopsy), stable disease, or radiographic evidence of persistent disease
           in the neck receive docetaxel once weekly for 4 weeks and undergo concurrent
           radiotherapy once or twice daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV on weeks 1 and 4 and undergo concurrent
           radiotherapy once or twice daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 3, 12, and 24 months.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1
      year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 330 patients will be accrued for this study.

      This is a prospective, interventional, multi-centre, phase III, randomized, double blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel design trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability
      of favipiravir as adjunct ('add on') to supportive care, in comparison to placebo with
      supportive care, in the acute treatment of patients who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2
      and presenting with moderate to severe COVID-19.

      This study will be conducted in two parts; Stage I - Main study and Stage II - Extended
      Follow up.
    ",Clinical Trial Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Favipiravir in Moderate to Severe COVID-19 Patients,Covid19,COVID-19,"
      Stage I - Main Study:

      All the eligible patients will be randomized to receive either favipiravir + supportive care
      or placebo + supportive care. The treatment duration with the IMP will be for a period of 10
      consecutive days. If the patient is discharged before Day 10, the patient will be required to
      continue the remainder of the treatment course of the assigned IMP at home. Patients in both
      the groups will receive supportive care, as appropriate. The duration of supportive care will
      be based upon Investigator's judgement and as per individual patient's requirement. The study
      data collection period will be up to 28 (+2) days.

      Day 10 will be considered as the End of treatment (EOT) assessment.

        1. If the patient remains in the hospital until Day 10, the EOT will be performed at the
           site and all the scheduled assessments for Day 10 will be performed

        2. If the patient is discharged before Day 10, the EOT can be performed either as an onsite
           visit or will be performed at the patient's home :

             1. On-site visit: If the patient is able to visit the hospital on Day 10, procedures
                for an unscheduled visit will be performed.

                OR

             2. At home: If the patient is unable to visit the hospital for the EOT, study nurse or
                phlebotomist will visit the patient at his/her residence to collect blood sample
                for safety assessments. A telephonic follow up will be performed to enquire on
                treatment emergent AEs experienced, concomitant medication and COVID-19 associated
                symptom for assessment of clinical relapse.

      Day 28 will be considered the end of study visit. If patient is discharged from the hospital
      before Day 28, the assessments mentioned in the end of study visit (Day 28) will be performed
      before the patient is discharged. After discharge, telephonic follow up will be performed on
      Day 10 (applicable only for patients who are discharged earlier than Day 10 and if patients
      are unable to visit the site for EOT on Day 10), Day 14, Day 21 and Day 28. The telephonic
      follow up will be as applicable for the individual patient, depending upon the actual day
      when (s)he is discharged. A 2-day window period is allowed for telephonic follow up.

      In case the patient remains admitted in the hospital beyond Study Day 28, the end of study
      assessments will be performed for the patient on Day 28 (+2) days.

      Stage I of the study will be completed when the 'Day 28' assessment is completed either as an
      in-patient assessment if the patient is still hospitalized, or as a telephonic follow up
      assessment if the patients are discharged earlier to Day 28.

      Once all the patients complete the Stage I of the study, the database would be locked, and
      analysis will be performed.

      Stage II - Extended Follow Up:

      All the patients will be followed up for AEs or for 'clinical relapse' of COVID 19. Two
      telephonic follow up assessments will be performed on Day 42 and Day 60. An additional visit
      to the hospital (for further assessment) may be scheduled for such patients, if required.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of 2 different types of biosynthetic

      At birth, the estimated gestational age and birth weight will be recorded, as well as the
      presence and type of other congenital anomalies.

      Prior to operation, the length of time from birth to repair will be recorded. To determine
      the severity of physiologic compromise, the need and type of ventilator support as well as
      the need and length of ECMO support will be recorded. The amount of time between ECMO
      discontinuation and repair will be recorded. The respiratory support required at the time of
      operation will be recorded.

      At operation, the size of the defect will be measured and recorded. The location (right
      versus left) will be recorded and special notation will be recorded regarding any areas where
      no diaphragmatic rim is present. The operative time and charges will be recorded.

      After the operation, the length of ventilator support, time to feeds, hospital stay, and
      hospital charges will be recorded. Post-operative complications such as bleeding
      complications, pneumonia, sepsis, gastroesophageal reflux, early recurrence and bowel
      obstruction will be recorded. Future operations and type of procedure will be recorded. If
      future operations in the abdomen are required, the amount and severity of intraperitoneal
      adhesions will be noted and recorded. Mortality will be recorded.

      After discharge, commensurate with standard current clinical practice, all patients will
      receive a follow-up appointment with a chest x-ray at 6 months and 1 year of life. After this
      time, follow-up appointments will be made each year for the first 5 years of life and imaging
      will be obtained on the basis of symptoms. Any further follow-up will be as needed for
      symptoms. Oxygen requirements, findings at follow-up and future hospitalization will be
      recorded, particularly looking at the presence or absence of hernia recurrence. The study
      will mature and effectively close when all subjects have reached 5 year follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with a diagnosis of congenital
             diaphragmatic hernia as proven by chest x-ray showing enteric contents in the thoracic
             cavity will be considered. Those who have birth weight equal to or over 2.2 kilograms
             and who are at or beyond 34 weeks gestation at the time of birth who survive until an
             operation can be performed will be considered. At operation, the patients with
             posterolateral diaphragmatic defects (Bockdalek Hernia) large enough to require
             placement of a patch to recreate the diaphragm will be included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children diagnosed outside of the neonatal period will not be considered. Patients
             with the less common anteromedial or substernal defect (Morgagni Hernia) will not be
             included in the study as their physiology and rate of recurrence are incomparable to
             common posterolateral, Bockdalek Hernia.

        Those patients under 2.2 kilograms and less than 34 weeks gestation have poor lung maturity
        to compound their inherent difficulty with pulmonary parenchymal hypoplasia and pulmonary
        vasculature hypertension making their chances of survival extremely low. Further
        compounding their dismal circumstance, they are not candidates for salvage extracorporeal
        membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Therefore, they will not be candidates for the study.

        The rare case requiring repair of the hernia while on ECMO support will not be included due
        to the fact that this population has a very poor survival secondary to irreversible
        pulmonary hypertension. Further, the operation is performed while the patient is
        anticoagulated with heparin which is fraught with operative and post-operative bleeding.

      Leronlimab (PRO 140) is a humanized IgG4,k monoclonal antibody (mAb) that recognizes the C-C
      chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5). CCR5 is expressed predominantly on T cells but also found
      on macrophages, dendritic cells, and eosinophils to mediate chemotaxis in response to its
      cognate ligands that include CCL5 (RANTES), CCL3 (MIP-1α), and CCL4 (MIP-1β). These ligands
      are integral in the recruitment of these immune cells to inflammatory sites. The
      immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 likely involves the excessive influx of immune cells into the

      Aromatase is an enzyme expressed in tissues such as muscle and fat in postmenopausal women.
      These non-ovarian tissues become the dominant sources of estrogen in postmenopausal women.
      Breast cancer cells are often very dependent on estrogens to continue to grow. Atamestane
      blocks the formation of estrogens from androgenic precursors in the body via the aromatase
      enzyme. Toremifene blocks circulating and intracellular estrogens from stimulating estrogen
      receptors in breast cancer cells. The goal of therapy with atamestane, an aromatase
      inhibitor, in combination with the estrogen receptor antagonist, toremifene, is to achieve
      complete suppression of estrogen stimulation of breast cancer cells. This study is designed
      to determine whether combined hormonal therapy will lengthen the time to disease progression
      and the survival time for subjects with advanced breast cancer.

      Background: Dexamethasone is a steroid, which is often given into the vein before
      chemotherapy to help control acute nausea and vomiting. It can also be given as an oral
      tablet for patients to take for the two days following chemotherapy to help minimise delayed
      nausea and vomiting. In chemotherapy regimens that cause high rates of nausea and vomiting,
      the use of dexamethasone is well proven. However, in chemotherapy regimens that generally
      cause only minimal to moderate rates of nausea and vomiting, the value of oral dexamethasone
      in the 48-hour period after chemotherapy is not well proven, although it is often prescribed.
      While dexamethasone does decrease nausea, it causes additional side-effects such as insomnia,
      indigestion, anxiety and mood changes. While patients with less vomiting and nausea are
      expected to have better quality of life (QOL), for patients with minimal nausea or vomiting,
      their QOL might be more affected by the side effects of the dexamethasone treatment than by
      the nausea.

      Study Design: The study will be performed in patients who will be receiving first line
      chemotherapy treatment with a moderate risk of nausea/vomiting. Anti-nausea therapy for acute
      nausea/vomiting will be standardised and all patients will receive non-steroidal medication
      for delayed nausea control. Each patient will be randomly allocated to receive either oral
      dexamethasone or an identical appearing placebo tablet for two days after chemotherapy for
      the first cycle of chemotherapy, and then crossed over to the other treatment for the second
      cycle. Patients will complete QOL assessments, dexamethasone symptom and nausea and vomiting
      questionnaires, as well as nausea/vomiting diaries. This will enable the researchers to
      determine the effect of dexamethasone on nausea and vomiting and the impact of both the side
      effects of dexamethasone, and of nausea and vomiting, on QOL.

      Objectives: The primary objectives are to determine patient preference for dexamethasone or
      placebo, and to compare changes in QOL after chemotherapy in patients who receive
      dexamethasone with those who receive placebo. The secondary objectives are: (1) to compare
      complete protection from delayed vomiting and severity of nausea; (2) to compare differences
      in the impact of nausea and vomiting on QOL, and (3) to compare differences in symptoms that
      have been associated with dexamethasone (insomnia, anxiety, agitation, mood, etc.) between
      patients receiving dexamethasone and those receiving placebo.

      Significance: This study will provide data to evaluate whether the benefits of dexamethasone
      for delayed nausea and vomiting outweigh potential side effects in patients receiving
      chemotherapy with a moderate risk of causing nausea and vomiting. This addresses a problem
      that is important to a majority of patients receiving anticancer chemotherapy. If overall QOL
      is improved on dexamethasone, then it should be prescribed more frequently, but if QOL is
      reduced on dexamethasone, and patients prefer the placebo, then its use as an anti-nausea
      medication for delayed nausea after moderately nauseating chemotherapy should be limited to
      patients with poor initial control of nausea/vomiting.
    ",Dexamethasone Study: Impact on Quality of Life of Continuing Dexamethasone Following Emetogenic Chemotherapy,"['Cancer', 'Emesis', 'Nausea']",,"
      Background: Dexamethasone improves control of acute nausea and vomiting when given prior to
      chemotherapy, and continued administration of dexamethasone improves nausea and vomiting
      after highly emetogenic chemotherapy. There is no consensus about the optimal regimen for
      control of delayed emesis after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy but most patients receive
      oral dexamethasone. Many patients complain of insomnia, anxiety/agitation and indigestion
      whilst they are on dexamethasone, and fatigue and depressed mood after stopping it. The
      impact of these symptoms on patients has not been studied systematically. While patients with
      less vomiting and nausea are expected to have better quality of life (QOL), the QOL of
      patients with minimal nausea or vomiting might be more affected by the side effects of
      antiemetic treatment.

      Hypothesis: Dexamethasone given as an antiemetic for delayed nausea and vomiting after
      moderately emetogenic chemotherapy reduces overall quality of life.

      Research Question: Does the use of dexamethasone as a prophylactic antiemetic for delayed
      nausea and vomiting following moderately emetogenic chemotherapy decrease overall quality of
      life, as evaluated by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality
      of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C-30).

      Study Design: Using a double-blind randomised cross-over design, we will determine:

        -  (i) the effect of oral dexamethasone (4mg PO bid after chemotherapy) versus an identical
           appearing placebo on QOL of patients that receive moderately emetogenic chemotherapy,
           and

        -  (ii) patient preference for dexamethasone or placebo.

      We will evaluate control of nausea and vomiting and the impact of both the side effects of
      dexamethasone and of nausea and vomiting on QOL. Therapy for acute emesis will be
      standardised (single dose intravenous granisetron and dexamethasone) and all patients will
      receive granisetron for delayed emetic control. Each patient will be randomly allocated to
      receive either dexamethasone or placebo after the first cycle of chemotherapy, and crossed
      over to the other arm for the second cycle. Patients will complete questionnaires that
      evaluate QOL, symptoms associated with dexamethasone, and nausea and vomiting at baseline and
      one week after their intravenous chemotherapy; they will also record symptoms in a daily
      diary.

      The primary outcome measures are patient preference and overall QOL. The secondary objectives
      are: (1) to compare complete protection from delayed vomiting and severity of nausea between
      those receiving dexamethasone and those receiving placebo; (2) to compare differences in the
      impact of nausea and vomiting on QOL in those receiving dexamethasone and those receiving
      placebo, and (3) to compare differences in symptoms that have been associated with
      dexamethasone (insomnia, anxiety, agitation, mood, etc.) between patients receiving
      dexamethasone and those receiving placebo.

      Significance: Our study will evaluate whether the benefits of dexamethasone for delayed
      emetic control outweigh potential side effects in patients receiving moderately emetogenic
      chemotherapy. It addresses a problem that is important to the majority of patients receiving
      anticancer chemotherapy. If overall QOL is improved on dexamethasone, then it should be
      prescribed routinely. If QOL is reduced on dexamethasone, and patients prefer the placebo,
      then its use as an antiemetic after moderately emetogenic chemotherapy should be limited to
      patients who initially have poor control of emesis.

      Infants with gastroschisis typically have poor intestinal motility for the first weeks to
      months after birth. Prokinetic agents are often used in these infants to improve intestinal
      motility in an attempt to quicken the attainment of enteric feeds. However, the evidence to
      support this practice remains weak. Investigators hypothesize that a prokinetic agent given
      intravenously (infused into a vein) may be effective in improving gut motility in children
      with gastroschisis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if sublingual allergen immunotherapy tablets work
      by inducing a state of desensitization in mast cells and basophils.
    ",Desensitization and Cross-Desensitization During Oral Grass or Ragweed Pollen Immunotherapy,Immunologic Desensitization,,"
      To induce clinical tolerance, a failure to respond to an allergen to which one was previously
      responsive, is an important objective for physicians, one that plays a significant role in
      the primary prevention of allergic reactions in the clinical practice of Allergy &
      Immunology. The tolerance resulting after standard subcutaneous immunotherapy to aeroallergen
      and insect venom allergens is long lasting and allergen-specific, and may involve
      antigen-specific T regulatory cells. In contrast, tolerance resulting from drug
      desensitization protocols is short-lived, and postulated to target mast cells and basophils.
      Research into the cellular and biochemical processes by which desensitization occurs has
      revealed that mast cells desensitized to one antigen in vitro, under certain conditions, lose
      the ability to degranulate to unrelated antigens or to direct FcεRI cross-linking.
      Preliminary data suggests that this cross-desensitization can happen in patients undergoing
      incremental desensitization, depending in part on the percentage of IgE targeted to the
      allergen used for desensitization. This proposal therefore aims to explore desensitization
      and cross-desensitization in human volunteers undergoing standard sublingual (SL)
      immunotherapy to grass or ragweed pollen.

      Subjects will undergo SL immunotherapy with either Timothy or Short Ragweed tablets, taking
      one tablet per day, or will take a placebo tablet. Titration skin testing to Timothy or Short
      Ragweed, to one or preferably two additional allergens to which the subject is sensitive, and
      to codeine as a control for mast cell activation capability through a non-IgE-dependent
      pathway will be performed to determine the PC3 value (see below). Skin testing, including
      histamine and diluent controls, will be performed prior to and at one and four weeks after
      initiation of immunotherapy. At each time point, blood will be obtained to measure total and
      antigen-specific IgE levels, tryptase and cytokine levels, and basophil activation with the
      relevant allergens and C5a as a non-IgE-mediated control for basophil activation.

      This was a multicenter, Phase III study in participants with metastatic Ewing's sarcoma
      Family of Tumors (ESFT) refractory/intolerant or recurrent to 1 prior line of chemotherapy.
      Participants who agreed to participation had tumor tissue harvested from a scheduled standard
      surgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy or palliative resection). The tumor tissue removed was
      shipped to Gradalis, Inc. to attempt to manufacture the investigational product, Vigil.

      Subjects who met eligibility criteria including manufacture of a minimum of 4 doses of Vigil
      were randomized 1:1 to either Group A (Vigil + Irinotecan + Temozolomide (Tem/Iri)) or Group
      B (Irinotecan + Temozolomide). Screening for the main portion of the study occurred as early
      as one week but no later than 8 weeks following tumor procurement.

      Subjects received repeat cycles of treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, withdrawal of consent or other criterion was met for discontinuation from study.
      Subjects randomized to Group A (Vigil + Tem/Iri) received up to 12 doses depending upon the
      quantity of Vigil manufactured from the surgical specimen. 1 cycle = 21 days. If irinotecan +
      temozolomide was administered beyond 12 cycles, it was administered off study. Subjects
      randomized to Group B (Tem/Iri) may have crossed over to receive single agent Vigil every 21
      days following End of Treatment assessment and documented disease progression confirmed by
      central radiology vendor, for up to 12 doses of Vigil depending upon the quantity of Vigil
      manufactured.

      Participants were managed in an outpatient setting. Hematologic function, liver enzymes,
      renal function and electrolytes will be monitored. Blood for immune function analyses
      including IFNγ-ELISPOT analysis of cytotoxic T cell activation in response to autologous
      tumor antigens will be collected at tissue procurement, post-procurement screening and Day 1
      (prior to chemotherapy administration) at Cycles 2, 4, and 6, end of treatment (EOT), 3
      months after EOT, and every 6 months thereafter. Blood for ctDNA analysis was collected at
      tissue procurement, prior to chemotherapy administration at baseline and on Day 1 prior to
      chemotherapy administration at Cycles 2, 3, 4, and 6, and EOT. After progression,
      participants were contacted quarterly for documentation of post study therapies and survival
      status information.

      Background and study aims: Being a caregiver for someone with cancer can be very difficult
      emotionally. For many the patient is a family member or friend, and so this can cause the
      caregiver a great deal of psychological distress. There are currently very few studies
      looking into the effectiveness of psychological treatments for distressed caregivers of
      cancer patients. This study is looking at tailored group therapy program for carers of cancer
      givers. The aim of this study is to find out whether this program can help to lower levels of
      distress in cancer caregivers and help them to better cope with caring for someone with the
      illness.

      Hepatitis C viral infection (HCV) leading to end-stage liver disease is the leading
      indication for liver transplant worldwide. HCV recurrence following liver transplantation is
      universal, associated with 100-fold increase in viremia levels, and runs at an accelerated
      course, leading to graft cirrhosis in up to 30% of patients within 5 years. Successful
      eradication of HCV post transplant normalizes the long term survival of HCV positive liver
      transplant recipients. This study aims to treat HCV infection starting at the time of
      transplant. The study is a single centre, single arm, open-label,proof of concept study

    ",Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Mexiletine in Patients With Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 and Type 2,Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 and Type 2,Myotonic Dystrophy,"
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study
      intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mexiletine in patients with myotonic
      dystrophy type 1 and type 2 (DM1 and DM2). The study will consist of a 4-week screening
      period and a 26-week treatment phase with patient visits as screening, baseline, weeks 1, 2,
      6, 14, 18, and 26. Eligible patients will be randomized to mexiletine or placebo in a 1:1
      ratio. Approximately 158 DM1 patients (79 active: 79 placebo) are planned to be enrolled
      across 10-15 experienced investigational centers in Europe. In addition, up to 16 DM2
      patients are planned to be enrolled (sub-group - 8 active: 8 placebo).

      Study drug (mexiletine 167 mg or placebo) will be started as a once a day (QD) treatment
      regimen. The dose will be titrated up at the Week 1 and Week 2 visits to a maximum of 1
      capsule three times a day. Depending on tolerability, the dose can also be either maintained
      or - if required - reduced by one dose step at any time during the study to a minimum dose of
      167 mg QD.

      In Phase 1 and 2 studies already conducted, Metformin DR, with its targeted delivery to the
      distal small intestine, has shown the potential to be a safe and effective way to improve
      glycemic control in patients with T2DM and CKD with less systemic metformin exposure. The
      primary purpose of this Phase 3 clinical study is to collect pivotal data confirming the
      safety and efficacy of Metformin DR in T2DM patients with varying renal function from normal
      up to CKD3B.
    ",Investigational Study of Delayed Release Metformin,"Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","['Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2']","
      The study is a multicenter, international study with a 28 week randomized, double blind
      parallel group, placebo and active comparator controlled period and a 24 week open label
      extension period in patients with T2DM who are treated with metformin at the time of study
      screening.

      Approximately 675 patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups. The study
      will assess change in HbA1c through 28 weeks for Metformin DR compared to placebo as a
      primary endpoint. In addition, assessments of change in HbA1c for Metformin DR compared to
      Metformin IR and assessment of absolute change in HbA1c will be evaluated in the study.

      Screening and Run-in Period:

      The study will include an up to 10-day screening period, an 4 to 8-week metformin washout
      period, and a 2-week single blind (patient blinded) placebo run-in period.

      Treatment Period:

      Patients that are determined eligible based upon the screening and run-in criteria will enter
      the 28-week double-blind treatment period. During the double-blind treatment period, patients
      will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups (Group A, B, or C) in a 1:1:1 ratio. The
      3 treatments are Metformin DR (1800 mg Metformin DR with matching placebo for Metformin IR),
      Metformin IR (1500 mg Metformin IR with matching placebo for Metformin DR), and placebo
      (matching placebo for Metformin IR with matching placebo for Metformin DR). For those
      patients randomized to Metformin IR, their Metformin IR dose will be titrated to prevent
      gastrointestinal intolerability:

      Open Label Extension Period:

      Upon completion of the 28 week treatment patients will be eligible for an additional 24 weeks
      of open label extension period where assigned study treatment will continue and additional
      efficacy, safety and tolerability data will be collected and analyzed.

      with mild-to-moderate asthma, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Armstrong's
      Albuterol-HFA MDI, in comparison to a Placebo Control and an Active Control of Proventil-HFA.
      While Albuterol-HFA (Treatment T) and Placebo (Treatment P) will be double-blinded to both
      the subjects and investigational staff, the active comparator drug, Proventil-HFA (Treatment
      R), can only be evaluator-blinded, due to: (1) its physical appearance differing from that of
      the T and P devices; and (2) unavailability of a Proventil-HFA placebo which would otherwise
      be used for a double-dummy design. All study medications will have the canisters and all
      product-identifying text or graphics (e.g., molded text on actuator) masked so that the
      treatments cannot be identified. No subject in any study arm will be given any information
      that could reveal the nature of the treatment given. All study subjects will be instructed
      not to reveal or discuss the study medications to the study staff or other subjects. The
      designated study evaluator(s), who conduct the clinical visits and safety and efficacy
      evaluations and perform the data recording and transcription, will be blinded to the study
      medications.

      All subjects will be screened for enrollment, and will be randomized into the following three
      treatment groups in a double-blinded (for Treatments T and P) or evaluator-blinded (for
      Treatment R) manner:

      Treatment T (Albuterol-HFA, N=200): 216 mcg albuterol sulfate (equivalent to 180 mcg
      albuterol base), QID; Treatment R (Proventil-HFA, N=50): 216 mcg albuterol sulfate
      (equivalent to 180 mcg albuterol base), QID; Treatment P (Placebo-HFA, N=50): two actuations
      of placebo, QID.

      Randomization is achieved with blocks of six (6), with four (4) patients receiving
      Albuterol-HFA for every one (1) patient receiving Proventil-HFA and every one (1) receiving
      the Placebo-HFA. At each Clinical Visit that takes place every 3 weeks, the double-blinded
      (T, P) or evaluator-blinded (R) study drugs will be distributed in resealable masking pouches
      to the subjects of each arm.

      An additional aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of weekly cleaning on the

           treatments and those who assess the results do not know the treatment received by the
           patient.

      Methods. Patients 65 years of age or older will be included, diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2
      coronavirus infection, in which no more than 7 days have elapsed since the onset of symptoms
      or diagnosis to plasma infusion.All patients included in the study will receive the same
      standard treatment that is deemed appropriate at any time, understanding as standard
      treatment that established at any time by the guidelines established.Infusion of 300 cc of
      convalescent donor plasma from COVID 19, administered within more than 168 hours from the
      onset of symptoms. For the study to be blind, the infusion of non-convalescent donor plasma,
      obtained before the start of the epidemic, is required to guarantee the absence of anti-COVID
      antibodies in the plasma of the control group.

      Analysis of data:

      Initially, the homogenization of the data referring to the two groups of studies will be
      evaluated. Classical statistical tests will be applied, such as Wilcoxon's non-parametric
      tests for the comparison of means of continuous variables, as well as the Chi-square test (or
      Fisher's exact test) to evaluate the association between categorical variables. The result
      variables are:

        1. Hospital admission

        2. Clinical course

        3. Mortality

        4. Complications and/or adverse effects of plasma.

      Sample size for the main objective To calculate the sample size, it is assumed that the
      hospital admission rate in this age group is 17%, obtained from the Galdakao Hospital
      database during the second peak of the pandemic (from 6/15/2020 to 9/8/2020).

           bilateral contrast, 91 subjects are needed in the first group and 91 in the second to
           detect as statistically significant the difference between two proportions, which for
           group 1 is expected to be the proportion of admitted patients is more than 17 in the
           control group and 5% or less in the intervention group, for which, assuming a percentage
           of losses of no more than 10% in follow-up, at least 100 patients in each branch. The
           arcsine approximation has been used.

      Data analysis and interim study For the calculation of the results, the Statistical Analysis

        -  Participation in another clinical trial or study.

        -  History of allergy to amotosalen or psoralens Donor selection and plasmapheresis

      For the selection of donors and plasmapheresis, the recent criteria developed by the
      Scientific Committee for Transfusion Safety (CCST) of the Ministry of Health Version 2.0 -
      April 15, 2020 ""RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OBTAINING PLASMA FROM CONVALESCENT COVID-19 DONORS"" are
      adopted. Donors will meet the standard criteria for blood donation, except the recent
      diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in addition the following:

        1. Signed the specific informed consent document for donation for the trial. In the event
           that the trial becomes multicenter, the plasma of the donors recruited by each center
           will be reserved for the patients included in it, unless expressly agreed by the centers
           involved for specific cases.

        2. Having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the last 3 months, confirmed by PCR or a technique
           of similar specificity.

        3. Those cases that have presented a mild infection, without confirmation by PCR, but that
           meet criterion 7 may be included.

        4. Meet both criteria:

             1. Minimum of 14 days without symptoms

             2. At least one negative PCR for viral RNA in the upper respiratory tract.

        5. Not having received corticosteroids in the last week.

        6. Presence of anti-COVID-19 immunoglobulin G ( IgG) antibodies by immunoassay or similar
           reliability.

        7. Those who have reached 18 years of age and preferably under 60 years of age, although in
           the event of de-provisioning it is considered that the age range can be extended to 65
           years of age, provided that the general condition of the donor allows it.

        8. Preferably they will be men who have never been transfused.

        9. The plasma obtained from the donor will be, whenever possible, subjected to inactivation
           treatment or quarantine.

       10. The donor will sign the standard informed consent document for the donation of plasma
           from the Basque Center for Transfusion and Human Tissues of the Basque Autonomous
           Community.

      The INTERCEPT™ Blood System for Plasma is used for plasma inactivation. The system uses a
      solution of amotosalen.

      Intervention Treatments in both arms of the study All patients included in the study will
      receive the same standard treatment that is deemed appropriate at any time, understanding as
      standard treatment that established at any time by the guidelines established by the
      Department of Health, or by the Osakidetza Directorate, in each moment.

      Treatment in the intervention group:

      Infusion of 300 cc of convalescent donor plasma from COVID 19, administered within more than
      168 hours from the onset of symptoms

      Treatment in the control group:

      For the study to be blind, the infusion of non-convalescent donor plasma, obtained before the
      start of the epidemic, is required to guarantee the absence of anti-COVID antibodies in the
      plasma of the control group.

      Monitoring, recording and communication of Adverse Events (AA), Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR),
      and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Any detrimental medical event that occurs in a patient to
      whom the plasma has been administered, although not necessarily causally related to such
      treatment, will be monitored, recorded, and reported. The physician must record in the
      medical record all AEs, ADRs, and SAEs that occur from the time the patient signed the
      informed consent until 28 days have elapsed after the patient's last follow-up visit within
      the study. Evaluation of adverse events: a qualified physician will assess all adverse events
      with respect to their severity. The adverse effects observed will be communicated by the
      usual haemovigilance means established by Law (ROYAL DECREE 1088/2005, of September 16, which
      establishes the technical requirements and minimum conditions for blood donation and
      transfusion centers and services). Additionally, the adverse effects observed will be
      reported to the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products.

      Operating process

        -  A single dose of plasma (300 mL) immune anti-coronavirus or not, depending on what
           corresponds will be infused.

        -  The collaborating staff will enter the initial and follow-up data in Red Cap based on
           the information contained in Osabide, or by talking to the patient by telephone to
           clarify any doubts.

      Bupivacaine is a drug that is traditionally given as an injection to numb surgical sites.
      Liposomes are molecules that are similar to fats. Sometimes drugs are combined with liposomes
      to make them able to stay in the body for longer periods of time. This has been done with
      bupivacaine to create liposomal bupivacaine.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the effects of bupivacaine to those of
      liposomal bupivacaine when given to patients who are having gynecologic surgery. Researchers
      want to compare how long the drugs work to numb the wound and how long patients take to
      recover from surgery.

        -  If you are in Arm 1, you will receive bupivacaine only.

        -  If you are in Arm 2, you will receive a combination of liposomal bupivacaine and
           bupivacaine.

      You will have an equal (50/50) chance of being assigned to either group. You will not know
      what you are receiving. However, the study staff will know what you are receiving.

      In both cases, the drug(s) will be injected into your skin and tissue at the end of your
      surgery, right before the wound is closed.

      Study Data Collection:

      Every day while you are in the hospital recovering from surgery, you will be asked questions
      about pain, any side effects you may be having, symptoms, and opioid use.

      Within 30 days after you leave the hospital, you may also be called and asked about side
      effects you may be having. If you are called, this call should last about 10-15 minutes. This
      information may also be collected during a routinely scheduled clinic visit and from the
      medical record.

      Three (3) and 7 days after you leave the hospital, and then 1 time every week after that for
      a total of 8 weeks, you will be called or emailed and asked questions about any symptoms you
      may be having. If you are called, each call should last about 10-15 minutes.

      If you are also enrolled on the study BS99-094 ""Measuring the Symptom Distress of Cancer
      Patients: Development of a New Assessment System,"" information from your participation in
      this study may also be collected and used in that study.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over 8 weeks after you leave the hospital.

      This is an investigational study. Both bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine are FDA approved
      and commercially available. It is investigational to compare the 2 drugs.

      Up to 200 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy, surgery,
      and radiation therapy with or without dexrazoxane and trastuzumab in treating women who have
      stage IIIA, stage IIIB or stage IV breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Chemoprotective drugs,
      such as dexrazoxane, may protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy.
      Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known if chemotherapy combined with
      surgery and radiation therapy is more effective with or without dexrazoxane and trastuzumab
      in treating breast cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the time to locoregional recurrence, time to completion of treatment, and
      overall survival in women with HER-2+ stage IIIA or IIIB or regional stage IV breast cancer
      treated with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with or without dexrazoxane, followed by
      paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab (Herceptin), followed by surgery and radiotherapy with
      or without trastuzumab.

      II. Determine whether addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel therapy improves response at 24
      weeks of therapy in these patients.

      III. Determine whether addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel therapy increases the rate of
      cardiotoxicity in these patients.

      IV. Determine whether addition of dexrazoxane to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide compromises
      response in these patients.

      V. Determine whether addition of dexrazoxane to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide reduces the
      rate of cardiotoxicity in these patients.

      VI. Determine whether long-term trastuzumab after local therapy improves disease-free
      survival in these patients.

      VII. Determine whether long-term trastuzumab after local therapy increases the rate of
      cardiotoxicity in these patients.

      VIII. Determine the occurrence of any grade 3 or higher toxicity, second malignancies, acute
      myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome in patients treated with these regimens.

      IX. Determine the eventual rate of breast conservation in those patients considered
      candidates for breast conservation prior to neoadjuvant treatment.

      X. Determine the clinical response after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with or without
      dexrazoxane and the clinical/mammographic/ultrasound response after paclitaxel with or
      without trastuzumab, compared to the pathologic response at definitive surgery in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to stage (inflammatory vs noninflammatory inoperable stage III/ regional stage IV
      vs operable stage III). Patients are randomized to 1 of 8 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive dexrazoxane IV over 10-20 minutes, doxorubicin IV over 5-10 minutes,
      and cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 85, 92,
      99, 106, 113, 120, 127, 134, 141, 148, 155, and 162. Approximately 1-2 weeks after completion
      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo breast conservation surgery, modified radical
      mastectomy, or mastectomy. Patients with unacceptable toxicity or locoregional disease
      progression may undergo surgery prior to week 24 (i.e., completion of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy). Beginning 2-4 weeks after breast conservation surgery or 3-5 weeks after
      mastectomy, patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6-8 weeks. Patients receive
      long-term trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes weekly for 40 weeks beginning on week 36 (day
      254).

      Arm II: Patients receive dexrazoxane, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide as in arm I. Patients
      receive paclitaxel (without trastuzumab) as in arm I. Patients undergo surgery and
      radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients receive long-term trastuzumab as in arm I.

      receive paclitaxel as in arm II. Patients undergo surgery and radiotherapy as in arm I.
      Patients undergo observation as in arm III.

      Arm V: Patients receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (without dexrazoxane) as in arm I.
      Patients receive paclitaxel and trastuzumab as in arm I. Patients undergo surgery and
      radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients receive long-term trastuzumab as in arm I.

      Arm VI: Patients receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as in arm V. Patients receive
      paclitaxel as in arm II. Patients undergo surgery and radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients
      receive long-term trastuzumab as in arm I.

      Arm VII: Patients receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as in arm V. Patients receive
      paclitaxel and trastuzumab as in arm I. Patients undergo surgery and radiotherapy as in arm
      I. Patients undergo observation as in arm III.

      Arm VIII: Patients receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as in arm V. Patients receive
      paclitaxel as in arm II. Patients undergo surgery and radiotherapy as in arm I. Patients
      undergo observation as in arm III.

      Treatment continues in all arms in the absence of distant disease progression. Beginning
      within 12 weeks of completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, hormone receptor-positive patients
      may receive oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 396 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.

      While there are effective treatments for depression available, some patients do not see
      results with these options. Often, these patients are referred to electroconvulsive therapy
      (ECT) which has drawbacks such as adverse side effects, cost, and limited access. Recent
      research shows that intravenous ketamine may be an alternative option for these patients due
      to its rapid antidepressant effect sustained with multiple treatments.

      This study will recruit 240 participants from the ECT waiting list at the five participating
      hospitals, and randomize them to either the ketamine or ECT treatment arm. Participants in
      the ketamine treatment arm will receive 0.5mg/kg ketamine intravenously (IV) over 40 minutes
      as described in the study schedule. Participants in the ECT treatment arm will receive ECT as
      described in the study schedule and as decided by their treating physician. Throughout the
      study, clinical, neuroimaging, molecular, and cognitive assessments will be conducted.

      The aim of this study is to show that compared to ECT, ketamine treatment produces faster
      results, has less side effects, requires less or shorter hospitalizations, and is less
      expensive. The measures collected throughout the study (clinician scales, self-reports, blood
      samples, and neuroimaging) may help with predicting if future patients will respond to ECT or
      ketamine. This could lead to faster, more effective treatment for patient with depression.
    ",Ketamine Versus Electroconvulsive Therapy in Depression,"['Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Bipolar Depression']","['Depression', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Depressive Disorder, Major']","
      Worldwide, depression carries a significant burden. Although there are effective treatments
      for depression, many patients do not achieve remission, and any significant response usually
      occurs after a few weeks. The common approach for a rapid intervention in cases of severe
      depressive symptoms has been electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). There are drawbacks to ECT
      including a prior medical work-up, general anaesthesia, and the possibility of memory loss.
      Further, access to ECT is often limited. Comparatively, the most striking breakthrough in the
      field of mood disorders has been the rapid antidepressant effects of intravenous ketamine.
      The antidepressant response to ketamine often occurs within a few hours, and peaks within 24.
      Recent studies have documented that the benefits of ketamine can be sustained with repeated
      administration.

      This longitudinal, multi-centre, randomized, crossover clinical trial is funded in part by
      the Ontario Brain Institute through a sponsorship with the Canadian Biomarker Integration
      Network in Depression (CAN-BIND) research program. It will take place across five sites: the
      Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre (lead site), Douglas Mental Health University Institute,
      Providence Care Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and University Health Network.

      A total of 240 participants (accounting for 20% dropout) will be recruited over 30 months
      from ECT wait lists across the five sites and randomized to either the ketamine or ECT
      treatment arm. Participants in the ketamine treatment arm will receive 0.5 mg/kg IV over 40
      minutes in the recovery room of the ECT clinic as per the study schedule. Participants in the
      ECT treatment arm will receive ECT as per the study schedule and as decided by their treating
      physician. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for between six weeks and nine
      months, or until they leave the study or the study is terminated.

      Throughout the study, clinical, neuroimaging, molecular, and cognitive assessments will be
      conducted. Data will be collected using the Ontario Brain Institute's Centre for Ontario Data
      Exploration and Research Electronic Data Capture in order to coordinate data from the five
      sites.

      Participants randomized to the either treatment arm will receive thrice weekly treatments for
      3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively. Following the randomization
      phase, responders may move to the maintenance phase and non-responders may move to the
      crossover phase where they will receive the alternate therapy. During the crossover phase,
      participants will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12
      treatments respectively. Following the crossover phase, responders will move to the
      maintenance phase and non-responders will exit the study. During the maintenance phase,
      participants who achieved response with ketamine will receive weekly ketamine treatments for
      one month, treatment once every two weeks for two months, and monthly treatment for three
      months. Should participants in the ketamine arm relapse during monthly treatment, they may
      return to treatments once every two weeks. Participants who achieved response in the ECT arm
      will receive ECT treatment for six months based on decision of the treating physician in
      order to maintain a clinical response. Both treatment arms will have a follow-up visit during
      month seven.

      The aim of this study is to show that compared to ECT, ketamine treatment produces faster
      therapeutic action, has less side effects, requires fewer/shorter hospitalizations for
      patients, and will be less expensive because it does not require an anaesthesiologist and a
      psychiatrist to administer the various ECT protocols. Through the discovery of biomarkers to
      predict ECT or ketamine response or non-response, the anticipated effective treatment could
      be administered as a first line intervention for a subgroup of depressed patients, thereby
      ensuring a more time-efficient intervention.

      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the ability of maternal aspirin (ASA)
      therapy to prevent preterm birth for fetal indications prior to 32 weeks gestation in women
      with early onset Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR). Aspirin is a commonly used medication that
      blocks blood platelets from clumping. Aspirin crosses the placenta in a dose dependent mode.
      There is preliminary evidence in smaller studies that aspirin can block fetal platelet
      clumping and, therefore, slow down the progression of placental disease under specific
      circumstances. The optimal time for aspirin to work is when the fetus' placental dysfunction
      is still mild. The goal of this research study is to show if fetuses that receive aspirin
      through maternal intake at a dose shown to affect fetal platelet aggregation will be less
      likely to deliver before 32 weeks for fetal deterioration. The outcomes of patients that
      receive aspirin will be compared to women that receive standard FGR management but do not
      take any aspirin. The decision if a study participant receives aspirin or not will be
      randomly picked. Such a research study is called a randomized controlled trial.
    ",Transplacental Aspirin Therapy for Early Onset Fetal Growth Restriction,"['Fetal Growth Restriction', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Intrauterine Growth Restriction', 'Intrauterine Growth Retardation']",Fetal Growth Retardation,"
      Early onset FGR requiring preterm delivery by 32 weeks gestation complicates 1-5% of
      pregnancies and is an important health problem. Over 60% of children have long-term health
      consequences after being delivered for early onset FGR. There is no prenatal treatment for
      fetal growth restriction. The current management of FGR consists of fetal surveillance to
      detect a decline in the baby's health and deliver when this can be safely done. In a large
      number of early onset FGR, premature delivery is required to prevent the fetus from becoming
      more compromised or even dying in the womb.

      Placental dysfunction leading to early onset FGR is characterized by changes to the blood
      vessels of the placenta, leading to a decline in the amount of blood flow to the placenta.
      The arteries that run in the umbilical cord of the fetus (umbilical arteries) are important
      for nutrient exchange between the fetal and placental circulation. Many fetuses with early
      onset FGR have elevated resistance in the blood vessels entering the placenta. This results
      in decreased blood flow in the umbilical artery (UA). The blood flow in the umbilical artery
      is evaluated by a specialized ultrasound technique called Doppler ultrasound. Doppler
      ultrasound of the umbilical arteries examines the blood flow to see if there is evidence of
      abnormal blood flow into the placenta. When the amount of blood flow at the end of every
      pulse decreases, it is classified as elevated UA blood flow resistance. When the blood flow
      briefly pauses at the end of each pulse, this is called absent end-diastolic velocity (AEDV)
      or UA AEDV. When the blood flow reverses at the end of each pulse, this is called reversed
      end-diastolic velocity (UA REDV). In fetuses with elevated UA blood flow, the placenta can
      usually supply enough nutrients and oxygen for at least 9 weeks. After that time, delivery is
      typically required. The worsening of blood flow to UA AEDV, or even UA REDV, increases the
      risk for fetal deterioration and preterm birth within the next 2-6 weeks. Approximately, 80%
      of early onset FGR fetuses progress to UA AEDV, or even UA REDV, and then require delivery by
      32 weeks. There is no treatment that can stop this progression which is of critical
      importance in determining how much time is left for the fetus before delivery will be
      necessary.

      When patients in hospitals receive antibiotics they often develop diarrhoea. The consequences
      may be grave for the patient. Thus far, no preventive measure is available. The investigators
      hypothesize that the apathogenic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, administered in addition to
      the antibiotic, may prevent episodes of diarrhoea or may lead to less pronounced diarrhoea.
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators are carrying out a clinical trial in 1520 adult
      patients in several hospitals.

      Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) is a frequent condition in hospitalised patients
      receiving antibiotic treatment. The same is true for Clostridium difficile-associated
      diarrhoea (CDAD) with even more grave consequences of increased morbidity and mortality. The
      development and evaluation of preventive strategies is one key public health challenge. In
      the absence of clinically evaluated alternatives, probiotics have been suggested to be
      beneficial for the prevention of AAD and CDAD. However, data have so far been inconclusive
      and recently published meta-analyses strongly recommended large state-of-the-art clinical
      trials on probiotic substances for the prevention of AAD and CDAD. Since the efficacy,
      side-effects and modes of action of different probiotic bacteria and yeast are strain
      specific, benefits and risks cannot be generalised. The non-pathogenic yeast Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae var. boulardii (Sac. boulardii) is considered the most promising probiotic
      substance for the prevention of AAD and CDAD. We carry out a randomised, placebo controlled,
      double blind multicentre clinical trial to evaluate Sac. boulardii for the indication of
      prevention of AAD and CDAD in 1520 adult, hospitalised patients.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and floxuridine,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Hepatic arterial infusion uses a catheter to carry tumor-killing
      substances, such as chemotherapy, directly into the liver. Giving chemotherapy in different
      ways may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine together with an hepatic arterial infusion with floxuridine is more effective
      than giving oxaliplatin and capecitabine alone in treating patients who are undergoing
      surgery and/or ablation for liver metastases due to colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and an
      hepatic arterial infusion with floxuridine to see how well they work compared to oxaliplatin
      and capecitabine in treating patients who are undergoing surgery and/or ablation for liver

        -  Compare overall survival and liver PFI between the two treatment groups.

        -  Assess toxicity in each of the treatment regimens.

        -  Compare self-reported symptoms between two treatment groups.

      combination of resection and ablation) and prior adjuvant chemotherapy regimen (chemotherapy
      with vs without oxaliplatin vs no chemotherapy). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      All patients undergo surgical resection and/or hepatic cryoablation or RFA to remove a
      maximum of 6 colorectal hepatic metastases. Patients randomized to arm II also undergo
      intra-arterial catheter and if applicable, pump placement.

        -  Arm 1 (oxaliplatin and capecitabine): Within 4-6 weeks after surgery and/or ablation,
           patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily
           on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm 2 (oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and hepatic arterial infusion of floxuridine): Within
           4-6 weeks after surgery and/or ablation, patients receive a continuous hepatic arterial
           infusion of floxuridine on days 1-14, oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 22, and oral
           capecitabine twice daily on days 22-35. Treatment repeats every 42 days for 4 courses in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Beginning with course 5, patients receive
           oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14.
           Treatment with oxaliplatin and capecitabine repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 4-6 weeks after surgery or ablation, approximately
      18 weeks after beginning of chemotherapy, and 4-6 weeks after beginning the last cycle of
      chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study.

      The goal of this study is to determine the safety (but not efficacy in preventing infection)
      of sterile-packaged and pre-loaded injectable solutions of both vancomycin and moxifloxacin
      at certain dosages and concentrations as prepared by a compounding pharmacy when used
      intracamerally at the time of cataract surgery.
    ",Intracameral Antibiotic Safety Study,"['Intracameral Antibiotics', 'Cataract Surgery', 'Phacoemulsification', 'Endophthalmitis', 'Vancomycin', 'Moxifloxacin']","['Endophthalmitis', 'Cataract']","
      Use of injectable prophylactic intracameral antibiotics during cataract surgery is gaining
      popularity worldwide due to the growing body of scientific evidence supporting its use. To
      date, there is no sterile-packaged antibiotic that has FDA approval for this indication.
      Surgeons using intracameral injectable antibiotics during cataract surgery must use existing
      pharmaceuticals off-label and/or rely on imprecise and sub-sterile compounding pharmacies to
      dispense these types of medications. Both of these scenarios may pose significant risk to
      patient safety.

      Description of the Treatment: Approximately 0.2 mL of either pre-loaded sterile vancomycin
      hydrochloride 1% solution (1 mg/0.1 mL of normal saline) or moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.15%
      solution (150 μg/0.1 mL of normal saline) is injected into the eye with a blunt tip 30 gauge
      cannula through a small clear corneal incision as the last step in the cataract removal
      procedure. The purpose of the treatment is for prophylaxis against post-operative infections
      and endophthalmitis.

      Description of Effector Pharmaceuticals/Drugs: Vancomycin is a hydrophilic glycopeptide
      antibiotic that has been well studied in many different forms: intravenous injectable, oral
      tablet and even topical eye drop solutions. It is derived from Actinobacteria spp.
      Moxifloxacin is a synthetic fourth generation fluoroquinolone and has, likewise, been
      available in many forms including intravenous injectable, oral tablet and topical eye drop
      solutions. In this study, a contracted compounding pharmacy will produce the two
      pharmaceutical agents at the concentration/dosage mentioned above under the USP 797
      guidelines.

      Therapeutic Mode of Action: The primary mode of action for vancomycin is inhibition of cell
      wall synthesis in gram positive bacteria. The molecule forms hydrogen bonds with terminal
      amnio acid moieties of the N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) polymer.
      The disruption to the polymerization and cross-linking of NAM-NAG complexes undermines the
      structural integrity of the bacterial organism leading to bacteriostasis and eventually cell
      death. The primary mode of action for moxifloxacin is inhibiting DNA gyrases, both type II
      topoisomerase and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are essential for bacterial DNA replication
      to occur.

      The purpose of the PRECISE trial is to determine whether overall survival duration, safety,
      and quality of life are improved for patients treated with IL13-PE38QQR compared to patients
      treated with GLIADEL® Wafer following surgical tumor removal in the treatment of first
      recurrence of glioblastoma multiforme.
    ",The PRECISE Trial: Study of IL13-PE38QQR Compared to GLIADEL Wafer in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme,Glioblastoma Multiforme,Glioblastoma,"
      PRECISE is a Phase III clinical trial of experimental drug IL13-PE38QQR (Study Drug).
      IL13-PE38QQR is a tumor-targeting agent administered by a continuous infusion directly into
      the brain around the cavity where the tumor has been removed. Through previous research, this
      Study Drug has shown potential to control some of the recurrent malignant gliomas, such as
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, and malignant mixed oligoastrocytoma.

      The Study Drug is made by combining a human protein (IL13) with a portion of a bacterial
      toxin protein, Pseudomonas Exotoxin (PE). The IL13 portion binds to receptors on the tumor
      like a ""key to a lock,"" allowing the PE portion to enter and kill those cells. Since tumor
      cells preferentially bind the drug, normal (healthy) brain cells are much less likely to be
      damaged by the drug. The Study Drug is delivered through tubing or catheters placed directly
      into the area surrounding the resection cavity. These catheters will be surgically placed
      from 2-7 days after the tumor has been removed. A pump is then used to slowly push the drug
      solution through the catheters using convection-enhanced delivery (CED) over a period of 4
      days.

      The GLIADEL® Wafer is an anti-cancer drug that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and sold for the treatment of recurrent or newly diagnosed GBM. Patients
      receiving GLIADEL® will have wafers placed at the time of surgery to remove tumor.

      Eligible patients enrolled in the PRECISE trial will be randomly assigned to receive either
      IL13-PE38QQR or GLIADEL® Wafer. Patients will have a 2 out of 3 chance to receive
      IL13-PE38QQR and 1 out of 3 chance to receive GLIADEL® Wafer.

      This study is being done to look at how well people respond to two very different drug
      treatments for depression. Clinically, people with depression can respond differently to drug
      treatments for reasons which are not always clear. Some of our own recent research suggests
      that people with depression who have a family history of bipolar disorder or completed
      suicide, may react differently to standard antidepressant medications than those without such
      a family history. Our data shows that family history of completed suicide, as well as the
      known predictor of family history of bipolar disorder, may help identify a pre-bipolar high
      risk group i.e. they currently have depression but at some future date will declare a bipolar
      illness (manic-depression) by virtue of development of a manic episode also. Our research
      suggests that treatment- emergent symptoms in response to a trial of antidepressant, such as
      agitation may be strong predictors of future bipolarity and inherently dangerous particularly
      as they are not ascribed to the antidepressant treatment. Finally, it is possible that this
      subgroup of those with depressive illness may respond better and more safely to lithium, a
      mood stabiliser used in known bipolar depression.

      The objective of this proposal is to investigate response to acute lithium treatment in
      subjects who meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression, but who are potentially at
      risk for bipolar disorder, by virtue of family history of bipolarity or completed suicide.
    ",Lithium Versus Paroxetine in Patients With Major Depression Who Have a Family History of Bipolar Disorder or Suicide,Major Depressive Disorder,"['Depression', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Depressive Disorder, Major', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Suicide']","
      Introduction: Bipolar disorder is an illness that consists of distinct episodes or ""poles"" of
      both major depression and mania (bipolar I) or major depression and hypomania (bipolar II).
      Both poles of the illness may be fully present simultaneously in what is referred to as a
      ""Mixed episode"". The ""poles"" of Major depression, Mania and Mixed mood are currently defined
      by descriptive criteria in the psychiatric diagnostic manual, DSMIV.

      Estimates of the prevalence of Bipolar disorder are as high as 6% of the population.(1) It is
      a severe and potentially lethal illness which has a different course and treatment profile to
      unipolar depression, commonly known simply as ""major depression"". In 50-60% of cases however,
      the initial presentation of bipolar disorder is one of major depression, and several episodes
      of depression may occur before declaration of bipolarity, by virtue of a manic or hypomanic
      episode (pre-bipolar depression).(2,3) The mainstay of treatment for unipolar major
      depression is antidepressants. In contrast, antidepressant monotherapy is contraindicated in
      Bipolar I depression and must be used very cautiously in Bipolar II illness (4) with much
      concern for an ""unacceptable cost /benefit ratio' because of the risk of antidepressant
      induction of mania and rapid cycling (increase in frequency of episodes as a consequence of
      antidepressants). (5). Hence treatment of the early depressive episodes of bipolar illness
      requires recognition of depression specific to bipolar disorder and appropriate choice of
      medication.

      Unfortunately, efforts to clearly distinguish bipolar from unipolar depression
      cross-sectionally have been mostly disappointing. Most evidence supports the value of family
      history(6) and there is variable predictive value for specific phenomenological and course
      descriptors such as hypersomnia, psychomotor retardation, early-onset and psychotic sub
      types(7,8).

      The dilemma then is two-fold:

        1. Identifying patients suffering from major depression who are at high risk of bipolar
           disorder.

        2. Choosing appropriate pharmacological treatment.

      In choosing pharmacological treatment for a ""high risk"" group, there is the possibility of
      causing harm with antidepressants if the true diagnosis is bipolar disorder, and of not
      treating the depression adequately if using mood stabilizers in what is truly a unipolar
      illness. This dilemma applies to a large subgroup of those presenting with depression. A
      recent study in a primary care setting suggested that as many as 21% of patients currently
      treated with antidepressants for a presumed depressive disorder may in fact have a bipolar
      diathesis, thus representing a large group that may be improperly treated(9).

      The concerns with the use of antidepressants in known bipolar depression have focused on
      antidepressant - induction of mania, and rapid cycling but these do not always present
      themselves immediately. However, there may be other subtle and immediate antidepressant
      treatment effects that make the diagnostic distinction possible and more
      pressing.(5,10)Indeed, it has been postulated that undetected bipolar depression may explain
      the apparent poor treatment response and increase in suicidality with the use of
      antidepressants in the adolescent population, where one might expect an increased prevalence
      of depression as first episode of bipolar disorder by virtue of earlier age of onset compared
      to unipolar illness.(11)

      Objectives:

      The objective of this proposal is to investigate response to acute lithium treatment in
      subjects who meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression, but are potentially at risk
      for bipolar disorder, by virtue of family history of bipolarity or completed suicide.

      Primary Hypothesis:

      Subjects with depression considered at risk for bipolar disorder, will show a significant
      clinical response to lithium.

      Secondary Hypothesis:

        1. Subjects with depression considered at risk for bipolar disorder, will show a
           significant clinical response to paroxetine.

        2. Treatment emergent mixed symptoms, in particular agitation, will occur only in the
           antidepressant treated group.

      Study Design:

      This is a 6 week double-blind randomized controlled pilot trial of lithium versus paroxetine
      in subjects with major depression who have either a family history of bipolar disorder or
      completed suicide. 20 subjects men or women above the age of 18 will be recruited at this
      centre.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either lithium or paroxetine at their first study
      visit and the dose of drug will be adjusted to find the right one for each patient. Patients
      will be assessed on a weekly basis thereafter.Data from this pilot study will help in the
      development of a larger adequately powered study to compare lithium and paroxetine in the
      treatment of depression in this high risk group.

      Patients excluded from the study would include subjects not able to give informed
      consent,pregnant or breast-feeding women,a current diagnosis of panic disorder, post
      traumatic stress disorder or psychosis,a history of mania or hypomania,active substance abuse
      or dependence in the last 6 months, a current depressive episode less than 4 weeks or greater
      than 12 months in duration, a current or prior adequate trial of lithium or
      paroxetine,concurrent use of other antidepressants or augmenting agents for the treatment of
      depression,or a clinically significant medical illness, in particular renal impairment.

      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy affecting
      1:3500 male births worldwide. Despite an increase in our understanding of the disorder since
      the discovery and characterization of the causative gene and its product dystrophin in 1987,
      current therapeutic management remains largely supportive. Improvement in the treatment of
      DMD will depend upon the development of better therapies. Affected boys become symptomatic at
      3 to 5 years of age with proximal leg weakness that impairs mobility, ability to get up from
      a squat, and precludes a normal ability to run. By 8 years of age, some affected boys begin
      to lose the ability to walk and resort to a wheelchair for mobility. This shift from the
      ambulant to non-ambulant phase occurs in all boys with a diagnosis of DMD by age 12 years. In
      this study, participants will be randomized into groups after being screened to determine
      eligibility. Participants will then be followed for a 12-month investigation period.

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as gemtuzumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry
      cancer-killing substances to them. Sometimes the cancer may not need more treatment until it
      progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient. It is not yet known whether
      combination chemotherapy is more effective than observation when given as maintenance therapy
      in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia.

      methotrexate to see how well they work when given as maintenance therapy compared with

        -  Investigate in a preliminarily manner the outcomes of patients who fail to achieve or
           maintain PCR-negative PML-RARα fusion gene after consolidation therapy when treated with
           gemtuzumab ozogamicin. (Only one patient was treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin as part
           of protocol treatment. Therefore, results for this objective are not reported).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive oral tretinoin twice daily until morphologic
           complete remission (CR) or for a maximum of 90 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive cytarabine IV continuously
           on days 3-9 and daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 3-6.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients who achieve CR, CR with incomplete blood count recovery
           (CRi), or partial remission (PR) after induction therapy receive arsenic trioxide IV
           over 2 hours 5 days a week for 5 weeks. After a 2-week rest period, patients receive a
           second course of arsenic trioxide. Within 14-30 days after blood count recovery,
           patients receive oral tretinoin twice daily on days 1-7 and daunorubicin hydrochloride
           IV on days 1-3. Patients receive a second course of tretinoin and daunorubicin
           hydrochloride after adequate blood count recovery.

        -  Post-consolidation therapy: Patients who do not achieve molecular CR (CRm), but do
           achieve CR or CRi and are still PML-RARα-positive after consolidation therapy, receive
           gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 14 days
           for up to 6 courses or until PML-RARα-negative by PCR. (closed as of 8/15/10)Patients
           are stratified according to age (18 to 60 years vs > 60 years), acute promyelocytic
           leukemia (APL) risk group (low vs intermediate), and if the patient received
           consolidation therapy courses 3 or 4 (yes vs no) regardless of their CRm response. These
           patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. (Randomization and observation arm
           closed as of 8/15/10) All patients are non-randomly assigned to receive
           post-consolidation therapy.

             -  Arm I: Beginning 14-30 days after blood count recovery, patients receive oral
                tretinoin twice daily on days 1-7, oral mercaptopurine once daily on days 1-14, and
                oral methotrexate on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 1 year.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive no further chemotherapy. Patients are followed every 3
                months for 1 year. (Randomization and observation arm closed as of 8/15/10)
                Patients undergo blood collection periodically for cytogenetic studies. Samples are
                analyzed for PML-RARα fusion gene via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
                reaction (RT-PCR) assay and gene expression profiling.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years.

      Introduction:

      Analgesia following leg amputation is based on morphine administration. For elderly patients
      of ASA physical status 2 or 3, morphine sparing is possible when perinervous block techniques
      are used. Indeed, per operative placement of a perinervous catheter by the surgeon allows a
      morphine consumption decrease of about 30%. Nevertheless, the interest of a sciatic block
      providing analgesia in the tibial and fibular territories has still to be assessed in this
      indication.

      Phantom limb pain complicates leg amputation in 50 to 80% of cases. Risk factors of this
      complication are numerous, from central or peripheral origin. Phantom limb pain postpones
      patients' social and professional rehabilitation, and results in an increased medical
      consumption. Prevention of these pains has been studied in various clinical trials, and
      results need confirmation. Thus, epidural analgesia alone does not decrease the long term
      incidence of phantom limb pain.

      Objectives:

      Primary : To compare intravenous morphine consumption during the 72 first postoperative hours
      following leg (below knee) amputation of patients randomly assigned in two groups. One group
      benefit from perioperative locoregional analgesia by ropivacaine via a popliteal sciatic
      catheter, the other group is given placebo through the catheter.

      Secondary :

        -  To assess tolerance and adverse effects (myalgia, infection, adverse effects of local
           anaesthetics) of the popliteal sciatic catheter during the 72 first postoperative hours
           and on the 7th postoperative day, in patients with ASA physical status 2 or 3

        -  To compare tolerance and adverse effects of morphine during the protocol in the 2 groups
           of patients

        -  To assess the long term effects of the preoperative continuous popliteal sciatic nerve
           block: incidence of stump pain and phantom limb pain, time of outbreak, intensity (VAS),
           characteristics (French version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire and DN4 questionnaire),
           and the analgesic consumption over a year.

        -  To assess the possibility for the patients to use a prosthesis

      Population:

      Eighty four patients scheduled for leg amputation (below knee), randomly allocated in 2
      groups of forty patients, according to the type of analgesia. Patients were enrolled in the
      general and vascular surgery unit, CHU (University Hospital) Pellegrin Bordeaux.

      Methods:

      Randomised clinical trial, with two parallel groups, with direct individual benefit,
      double-blinded, realised on a population of patients undergoing leg amputation, comparing
      different clinical parameters of postoperative pain evaluation, and outbreak of phantom limb
      pain according to the group of analgesia.

        -  One group of patients with locoregional analgesia associated with morphine
           administration (assessed treatment)

        -  One group of patients with morphine analgesia only (reference treatment). Patients will
           be followed for one year. This study will last 3 years in a general and vascular surgery
           unit, inclusion will be realised during 34 months by anaesthetists and surgeons, an
           extension of this study for one year will be done with the objective of a cohort
           follow-up.

      Statistical analysis will be done with intention to treat.

      Anticipated results:

      To prove the efficacy of the continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block in postoperative
      analgesia after leg amputation.

      To prove the efficacy of a perioperative analgesia by continuous popliteal sciatic nerve
      block to prevent phantom limb pain after leg amputation in patients of ASA physical status 2
      or 3.

      This was a Phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-masked, parallel group study with 2
      masked arms in which participants were randomized 2:1 to receive brolucizumab or aflibercept.
      All participants had study visits every 4 weeks through week 104.

      The study consisted of three study periods:

      Screening Period: The screening period lasted up to 2 weeks prior to administration of the
      first dose of study treatment, dependent upon confirmation of the patient meeting eligibility
      criteria.

      Double-Masked Treatment Period: Participants meeting eligibility criteria entered the
      treatment period and were randomized in a 2:1 ratio into one of the following 2 masked
      treatment arms at the Baseline visit: Brolucizumab 6 mg injected every 4 weeks or Aflibercept
      2 mg injected every 4 weeks. Treatment period lasted up to week 100.

      Safety Follow up Period: Participants were followed up for safety during 4 weeks after the
      last dose of study treatment. Including the Screening Period, the total study duration for a
      participant was up to 106 weeks.

      Some participants were eligible to continue into an extension study in order to receive

      Although the incidence of the adenocarcinoma of the stomach is slowly decreasing, gastric
      cancer represents the second worldwide cause of cancer death after lung cancer. In patients
      with advanced disease, chemotherapy improves survival and quality of life. Combinations of
      two or three drugs including a platin derivative (cisplatin or oxaliplatin), a
      fluoropyrimidine (5FU or capecitabine) and an anthracycline (usually epirubicin) have
      demonstrated superiority compared to single or double agent therapy and are the current
      standard. As of today there are no published studies comparing anthracycline-based to
      taxane-based three-drug regimens. The objective of the present study is to compare EOX as
      evaluated in REAL-2 to the low-TOX regimen consisting of docetaxel, oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine. Low-TOX is expected to be better tolerated than the original DCF regimen. The

      The overall objective of LUCHAR Specific Aims 4.1 and 4.2 is to assess the additional
      contribution of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk markers to traditional biomedical risk
      factors in the prediction of pre-clinical CVD. Specific Aim 4.3 will test the impact of
      omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on risk markers and pre-clinical markers of CVD in
      Hispanic patients.

      Specific Aim 4.3: Conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of omega-3
      fatty acid supplementation on vascular function as measured by brachial artery reactivity
      (BAR) and on circulating inflammatory markers.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Daily omega-3 fatty acid supplementation will improve vascular function in subjects at
           high risk for CVD.

        2. Daily omega-3 fatty acid supplementation will reduce inflammatory protein panel scores
           in subjects at high risk for CVD.

      Omega-3 fatty acids reduce triglycerides (TG) in a manner similar to fibric acids by lowering
      hepatic TG release, reducing VLDL production, stimulating lipoprotein lipase and enhancing TG
      clearance. Although statins are widely utilized among DH patients, our overall population,
      even those with CHD, have fairly low levels of LDL-cholesterol (Krantz et al, 2004). This
      likely reflects our population that is predominantly Latino with a high incidence of
      metabolic syndrome. Among our patients, we often achieve LDL-c NCEP targets, yet secondary
      goals for non-HDL, HDL, and TG are rarely achieved. This is an unmet opportunity given the
      strong independent contribution of non-HDL (McQueen et al, 2008), HDL (D'Agostino et al,
      2008) and TG (Nordestgaard et al, 2007, Tirosh et al, 2007) to CHD risk, which may be
      particularly important in Latino populations.

      The study drug (LOVAZA) improves the TC/HDL ratio which is the strongest predictor of CHD
      events based on the ~30,000 patient Interheart study noted above. LOVAZA has no hepatic P450
      effects and for that matter no meaningful clinical adverse effects, making it advantageous
      for use in a population with multiple co-morbidities who are at risk for drug-drug
      interactions and have difficulty with medication adherence. Given the high incidence of
      insulin resistance among DH's predominately Latino CHD population, and strong lipid (Harris
      et al, 1997; Davidson et al 2007) as well outcome data in CHD (GISSI investigators, 1999)
      this agent has potential clinical utility in our population.

      To date, improved outcomes in non-CHD populations have not been demonstrated prospectively
      with LOVAZA. Although recent data suggest promising effects on inflammatory makers such as
      LpPLA2, the impact of LOVAZA on pre-clinical markers of atherosclerosis such as BAR and CIMT
      have not been well characterized particularly among Latinos. Moreover, changes in
      inflammatory markers have been limited and more expansive evaluations are currently
      available. Against this background we assessed whether LOVAZA might improve atherosclerotic
      risk via improvement in flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery as well as through
      reduction in a comprehensive inflammatory marker panel.

      RATIONALE: Biliary stenting is the placement of a tube in the bile ducts to keep a blocked
      area open. Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, such as porfimer sodium, that is absorbed by
      tumor cells. The drug becomes active when it is exposed to light. When the drug is active,
      tumor cells are killed. It is not yet known whether biliary stenting is more effective with
      or without photodynamic therapy in treating patients with biliary tract tumors.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying biliary stenting to see how well it
      works compared with biliary stenting and photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium in
      treating patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma or other
      biliary tract tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the efficacy, in terms of overall survival, of biliary stenting with vs
           without photodynamic therapy using porfimer sodium in advanced, recurrent, or metastatic
           biliary tract carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the two treatments arms with respect to progression-free survival, toxicity
           using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0), and quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating center,
      primary site (gallbladder vs bile duct), disease stage (locally advanced vs metastatic),
      prior therapy (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy) (yes vs no), performance score (0
      vs 1 vs 2 vs 3), and prior treatment arm on UK chemotherapy trial ABC-02 (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride alone vs gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo either endoscopic or percutaneous drainage and insertion of
           unilateral or bilateral plastic endoprostheses above the main strictures of the right
           and left hepatic bile ducts.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo treatment as in arm I. Patients also receive porfimer sodium IV
           and then undergo laser activation 48 hours later.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for at least 3
      years.

      Hypoparathyroidism is a rare condition associated with a low level of parathyroid hormone
      (PTH) in the blood. Hypoparathyroidism can be genetic and show up in childhood, or it can
      occur later in life. If it occurs later, it is usually due to damage or removal of the
      parathyroid glands during neck surgery. PTH helps control the amount of calcium in blood,
      kidneys, and bones. Low levels of calcium in the blood can cause a person to feel sick. It
      can cause cramping or tingling in the hands, feet, or other parts of the body. A very low
      blood calcium can cause fainting or seizures.

      The standard treatment for hypoparathyroidism is a form of vitamin D (calcitriol) and calcium
      supplements. Keeping normal blood levels of calcium can be difficult. Sometimes there is too
      much calcium in the urine even if the calcium levels in the blood are low. High calcium in
      the kidneys and urine can cause problems such as calcium deposits in the kidney
      (nephrocalcinosis) or kidney stones. High levels of calcium in the kidney may keep the kidney
      from functioning normally. Treatment with PTH will replace the hormone you are missing. Your
      disease may be better controlled on PTH than on calcium and calcitriol.

      Researchers at the NIH have conducted prior studies to establish synthetic human parathyroid
      hormone 1-34 (HPTH) as a treatment for hypoparathyroidism. Other studies have shown that PTH
      may improve calcium levels in blood and urine. The primary purpose of this research study is
      to evaluate the effects of synthetic human parathyroid hormone 1-34 (HPTH) replacement
      therapy on bone in adults and teenagers with hypoparathyroidism.

      The study takes 5 (Omega) years to complete and requires 12 inpatient visits to the National
      Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. The first visit will help the study
      team decide whether you are eligible. This visit will last 2 to 3 days. After taking calcium
      and calcitriol for 1 - 7 months you will return to the NIH Clinical Center for the baseline
      visit. The baseline visit is the visit that you will start your PTH; you will also undergo a
      bone biopsy during the visit. The baseline visit may last 7 to 10 days. You will then take
      PTH twice a day for 5 years. You will be asked to return to the NIH clinical center every 6
      months for 10 follow-up visits. During one of the follow-up visits, you will have a second
      bone biopsy taken from the other hip. That second biopsy will be done after 1 year, 2 years,
      or 4 years of taking PTH; the researchers will assign the timing of the second biopsy
      randomly. You will be asked to go to your local laboratory for blood and urine tests between
      each follow up visit. At first the blood tests will occur at least once a week. Later, you
      will need to go to your local laboratory for blood tests at least once a month and urine
      tests once every 3 months. The local laboratory visits and follow-up visits at the NIH
      Clinical Center will help the study team determine whether the HPTH treatment is controlling
      your hypoparathyroidism.

      Objectives

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the skeletal effects of hormone
      replacement therapy with HPTH in hypoparathyroidism.

      Study Population

      This study will enroll up to 69 subjects with physician-diagnosed hypoparathyroidism.<TAB>

      Design

      This study will treat hypoparathyroid individuals with synthetic human PTH 1-34 (HPTH) for up
      to 5 years, periodically assessing skeletal changes through biochemical markers and
      iliac-crest bone biopsies, which will allow for ultrastructural, cellular, and molecular
      analyses.

      With respect to HPTH treatment, this study is a single group, within-subjects, repeated
      measures treatment trial. With respect to all bone biopsy analyses, the design is a parallel
      group design with each subject allocated to one of the 3 biopsy follow-up times: 1, 2 or 4
      years after initiation of HPTH therapy. Post-baseline biopsy timing will be randomly assigned
      (1:1.2:1.4, respectively) to each subject, stratified by gender and by menopausal status,
      when relevant. Changes from baseline (time 0) to 1, 2 and 4-years will be compared. Subjects
      who were on conventional therapy in the former version of the protocol will also be
      randomized into the new study design. In contrast to new subjects, whose biopsy is performed
      at the end of the conventional care run-in period, the pre-conventional care biopsy will be
      used as the baseline for the those subjects entering the new design after having been on
      conventional care in the older protocol. Because it is not known with certainty what effects
      duration of time on conventional therapy will have on biopsy results, randomization will also
      be stratified on status of prior study participation. The subjects who were on HPTH therapy
      at the time of the protocol redesign are followed as a separate group under this protocol.

      Introduction: Nosocomial and/or healthcare-associated Staphylococcus aureus infections are
      common, serious conditions. S. aureus accounts for about 20% of cases of nosocomial
      bacteremia, and is associated with a mortality of 20-40%. This severity is due to the
      virulence of the bacterium, and the age and comorbidity of the patients in whom the infection
      occurs. First-line therapy is based on vancomycin, because the prevalence of methicillin
      resistance in S. aureus (~20%) is still high in the hospital environment. However the
      bactericidal activity of this drug is slow and it causes dose-dependent nephrotoxicity. The
      persistence of positive blood cultures after 72 hours, a parameter which in itself is
      predictive of the infection having a complicated clinical course, is seen in about 35% of
      patients receiving vancomycin therapy.

      Hypothesis: The use of daptomycin to treat nosocomial or healthcare-associated bacteremia due
      to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) would increase the proportion of patients whose
      blood cultures are sterilized after 72 hours by 15% relative to vancomycin and would improve
      treatment safety.

      Primary objective: To study the efficacy of daptomycin compared to vancomycin on the
      sterilization of blood cultures after 72 hours of therapy.

      Secondary objectives: Clinical cure at D14 and D28; relapse-free clinical and bacteriological
      cure at D90; mortality at D14, D28 and D90; treatment duration (in days) before sterilization
      of blood cultures; side effects occurrence during treatment, renal insufficiency; peripheral
      vein toxicity requiring placement of a central venous catheter; side effects requiring
      changes to the study treatment ; duration of hospitalization for bacteremia; increase of at
      least 2 dilutions in the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of daptomycin and/or
      vancomycin between the first and last clinical isolates of S. aureus.

      Methodology: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label study to compare daptomycin
      monotherapy to vancomycin monotherapy. Patients will be randomized if they have a nosocomial
      or healthcare-associated infection, a blood culture positive for Gram-positive cocci in
      clusters, and a rapid molecular diagnostic test(GENEXPERT) that confirm the presence of
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Daptomycin will be given once daily in monotherapy (10 mg/kg
      as a single infusion over 30 minutes into a peripheral vein). Standard therapy is vancomycin
      in monotherapy given by intermittent or continuous infusion so as to obtain trough
      concentrations of 15-20 mg/L or plateau concentrations of 20-25 mg/L, respectively. The
      treatment duration for bacteremia in both arms is 14 days of intravenous therapy for
      uncomplicated bacteremias and 28 days of intravenous therapy for complicated bacteremias,
      defined by persistent fever or positive blood cultures after 72 h of the study treatment,
      secondary septic localizations existing at enrollment, or presence of foreign material
      without signs of infection.

      The duration of the treatment of the study can be reduced if the patients answer the
      following criteria:

      Uncomplicated bacteremia: 10 days of treatment instead of 14 days if:

        -  2 sterilization of blood cultures

        -  Patient clinically cured

        -  Visit J14 realized in the center

      Complicated bacteremia: 21 days of treatment instead of 28 days if:

        -  2 sterilization of blood cultures

        -  Patient clinically cured

        -  Visit J28 realized in the center

      In every case, no oral relay has to substitute itself for the possible reduction of the
      duration of the treatment of the study.

      A blinded study design was not selected because the two treatments are administered very
      differently, due to the invasive nature of continuous infusion pumps, and because the primary
      objective concerns a microbiological outcome.

      Patient management and clinical monitoring will comply with usual good clinical practice for
      these patients. Visits on D14, D28 and D90 will be necessary. Laboratory monitoring will
      comprise daily blood cultures until sterile cultures are obtained on 2 consecutive days; full
      blood count (FBC), serum creatine, CPK before treatment, on D3, D7, D10 and D14 and, for
      patients receiving 28 days of treatment, D21 and D28. Where myalgia with elevation of
      creatine phosphokinase (CPK) > 5 N, or isolated elevation of CPK > 10 N occurs, treatment
      with daptomycin will be discontinued and clinical and laboratory-based monitoring will be
      maintained until normalization.

      Number of subjects required: After 72 hours of vancomycin therapy, blood cultures are still
      positive in about 35% of patients. The objective is to show the superiority of daptomycin in
      the sterilization of blood cultures after 72 hours, by a margin of 15% (80% versus 65%). With
      a power of 80% and a type I error rate of 5%, and addition of 10% to allow for unevaluable
      outcomes and death before 72 hours, the number of subjects required in each arm is 166 (total
      = 332 patients).

      Study logistics: Duration of the study: 2 years; Enrollment period: 21 months; Duration of
      each patient's participation: 3 months; Number of participating study sites: 15. Study sites
      were chosen on the basis of the blood culture system used, of there having been > 10
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus blood cultures in 2009 and the possibility of setting up
      rapid diagnosis for the trial.

      compared to fulvestrant and a placebo in treating postmenopausal women with stage III or
      stage IV breast cancer that is hormone receptor-positive. Estrogen can cause the growth of
      breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by lowering
      the amount of estrogen the body makes. Lapatinib may stop the growth of breast cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether

      I. To compare the effects of fulvestrant alone with fulvestrant and lapatinib on other
      clinical endpoints, including response rate, response and stable disease rate (complete
      response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease >= 6 months), duration of response,

      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is not
      yet known whether cisplatin is more effective when combined with paclitaxel or gemcitabine in
      treating cervical cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of cisplatin combined with
      paclitaxel to that of cisplatin combined with gemcitabine in treating women who have
      recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer.

           (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) of patients with recurrent,
           persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer treated with cisplatin and paclitaxel vs
           cisplatin and gemcitabine.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease status at study entry (metastatic vs recurrent vs persistent), prior cisplatin as a
      radiosensitizer (yes vs no), and extent of disease (confined to pelvis vs extrapelvic
      disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 24 hours on day 1 and cisplatin IV over 2
           hours on day 2.

        -  Arm II:Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV
           over 2 hours on day 1.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.

      ITP is a common disorder associated with significant morbidity. For more than 40 years it has
      been recognized that this disorder was responsive to corticosteroid therapy. As
      corticosteroids are easily obtainable and inexpensive, they have become the standard
      first-line therapy for adult patients with newly-diagnosed ITP. Generally, patients are
      treated with prednisone at a dose of approximately 1 mg/kg, or 60 mg/day, and once a response
      is obtained the daily dosage is gradually tapered. While approximately 70% of patients
      treated in this manner respond initially, most will relapse as the corticosteroid dose is
      lowered; ultimately only 15-20% of patients achieve a complete or partial remission of their
      ITP at an ""acceptable"" dose of prednisone. Recently, several studies have suggested that the
      use of high dose corticosteroids, specifically pulse dexamethasone, may be a more efficacious
      initial therapy for ITP, capable of causing a higher initial response rate and a
      significantly longer duration of remission despite a shorter course of initial therapy.

      This study will compare treatment with 3 courses of high-dose dexamethasone versus treatment
      with prednisone, for patients recently diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
      The primary hypothesis is that patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone will obtain a
      more durable remission than patients treated with standard oral corticosteroids. This may
      reflect the ability of high dose corticosteroids to eradicate a sensitive pathogenic lymphoid
      clone that may be transiently susceptible to aggressive immunosuppressive therapy early in
      the course of disease.

      In November 2019, Wuhan city in China, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia due to a
      novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) in
      February, 2020. The COVID19 is much more dangerous for people over 60 with a death rate of
      3.6% after 60, 8.0% after 70 and 14.8% after 80 -and according to our Italian colleagues over
      20% after 90- against 2.3% in the general population. The elderly patients who died most
      often had multiple comorbidities and in particular: cardiovascular disease (10.5% mortality),
      diabetes (7.3%), chronic respiratory disease (6.3%) and hypertension (6%). These elderly
      patients with COVID19 are therefore very fragile and require treatment that fights the virus
      but is also adapted to their state of health and age. Most of current therapeutic trials
      worldwide exclude people aged over 75 years, which is precisely the age group affected by
      COVID19. We therefore propose to carry out a therapeutic trial specific to the elderly with
      drugs at doses that are bearable for these patients. Using the WHO, clinicaltrial, pubmed and
      the Chinese CCDC/CHCTR websites to find the better drugs adapted to elderly people, we
      decided after concertation between infectiologists and geriatricians to do a four arms
      clinical trial during two weeks twice a day: Hydroxychloroquine 200mg, Telmisartan 40mg,
      Azithromycin 250mg and standard care. We therefore hypothesize that one or more of these
      treatments may have a beneficial effect in controlling COVID19, without major and repeated
      side effects in elderly patients.
    ","Efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine, Telmisartan and Azithromycin on the Survival of Hospitalized Elderly Patients With COVID-19",COVID-19 Infection,COVID-19,"
      In the absence of a validated treatment, any patient over 75 years -or demented above 60- of
      age arriving in one of our hospital centres with a COVID19 infection objectified by RT-PCR
      will be offered this therapeutic trial. Patients will be randomized. During their
      hospitalization, they will be closely monitored clinically. It means daily evaluation of
      temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, need for oxygen therapy and general
      clinical examination. The lung severity scale and WHO scale will be done daily. Any side
      effects of any kind, in particular serious side effects will be reported within 24 hours on
      the electronic CRF. RT-PCR with search for SARS-Cov-2 will be evaluated at D0, D7 and D14. A
      blood sample will be taken at D0, D7 and D14 with blood count, CRP and biobanking. Functional
      scales (ADL, confusion scale, walking) will be evaluated every 3 days. If death occurs, the
      precise circumstances and time of death will be transmitted, as well as the precise origin of
      death: only COVID19 or other associated disease (bacterial infection, heart failure, kidney
      failure, etc...).

      Symptomatic treatment will be at the discretion of the clinician, but will be recorded in the
      eCRF, particularly in relation to the use of corticosteroids or other immunomodulators.

      The study will consist of 1600 patients over 75 years of age (or above 60 demented) with
      COVID19 requiring hospitalization, equally divided into four groups with the following
      treatment during two weeks for each arm:

        -  Hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice a day

        -  Azithromycin 250 mg twice a day

        -  Telmisartan 40mg twice a day

        -  Standard care

      The choice of these three drugs was done considering the benefit-risk balance, i.e. by
      choosing drugs with few side effects but high potential for elderly people (including severe
      renal insufficiency). Hydroxychloroquine was chosen because 1. This drug was demonstrated to
      be potent and more potent than Chloroquine at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. An unpublished
      clinical trial with 100 patients showing superiority of chloroquine compared to placebo with
      improvement of lung image findings, promotion a virus-negative conversion and shortening the
      disease course . An open-label non randomized clinical trial with 42 patients showing a
      faster reduction of the virus in the Hydroxychloroquine treated group. Azithromycin was
      associated in the previous trial with Hydroxychloroquine with positive results on RT-PCR.
      Recently bioinformatic analysis conclude to SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibition with Macrolides.
      Moreover macrolides are known to have immunomodulatory effects, which could be of interest in
      the context of hyperinflammation. Telmisartan is an angiotensin 2 AT1 receptor antagonist.
      COVID19 use ACE2 as a receptor, a modulator of the activity of different angiotensin. The
      COVID19-ACE2 interaction increases the activity of angiotensin and thus increases the
      activity of the AT1 receptor, that results in increased pulmonary vascular permeability and
      therefore contributes to lung injury. Thus Telmisartan could be a protector against lung
      injury due to Sars-Cov-2, inhibiting AT1 receptor.

      The expected benefits are multiple thanks to this original project:

        -  1. There is a research emergency. No drug has been shown to be really effective against
           COVID19 and even less in the elderly, so therapeutic trials are needed.

        -  2. If one of these 3 drugs turns out to be positive, it could even be taken at a very
           early stage, for example as a result of a recent contagion, in elderly population at
           high risk of death.

        -  3. If one of the three treatments was positive, the cost-effectiveness would be very
           favorable compared to other treatments currently being tested. This could benefit a
           larger population, particularly in developing countries where COVID19 is arriving.

        -  4. This trial will be evolutionary, i.e. we will be able to add a treatment arm if a new
           molecule that is potentially effective in the elderly appears.

      To the best of our knowledge, there has been no randomized controlled trial to compare double
      dose PPI therapy with standard one dose PPI therapy for NERD patients. Thus, we hypothesize
      that a double dose PPI would accelerate and sustain the control of symptom in NERD patients.
    ",Double-dose Rabeprazole Accelerates and Sustains the Control of Symptoms in Patients With NERD,Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease,Gastroesophageal Reflux,"
      In Asian, the majority of GERD cases are cases of nonerosive reflux esophagitis(NERD). NERD
      is a difficult -to-treat acid reflux condition even with PPI compared to reflux
      esophagitis(RE). In addition, the quality of life of NERD patients is quite low, NERD
      patients need quicker and more effective treatment options. At present, PPI-based step-down
      treatment is recommended for GERD patients. Doubling th PPI dose has become a commonly
      practiced therapeutic strategy in patients with GERD who failed PPI once daily. In patients
      with symptomatic GERD who failed the one dose PPI can increase the rate of overall symptom
      improvement by 22-26%. There are various mechanisms for standard dose PPI failure in GERD
      patients. Esophageal hypersensitivity is likely the underlying mechanism in a significant
      number of patients. Patients with the sensitive esophagus (normal endoscopy and pH test but
      positive symptom index) were more likely to respond to PPI twice a day. It is thus of
      clinical interest to determine whether an increased dosage of PPI can achieve rapidly the
      control of symptoms for patient with NERD patients.

      Self identified African American patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were selected
      for this study as this population has the highest risk identified to date for developing an
      MI related to the HapK genetic variant in the leukotriene pathway. The study will be enriched
      to include African American patients randomized by an algorithm designed to assure that
      approximately 80% of the study population will be Hap K positive and 20% will not have the
      Hap K positive result.

      All patients will be screened for eligibility based on the haplotype status. Patients will be
      randomized to either veliflapon or placebo on top of standard care. Patients are randomized
      within 5-30 days of their ACS event.

      This is an events driven study with the time of the first occurrence of any of the following
      elements: hospitalization for UA or urgent revascularization, fatal/non-fatal MI,
      fatal/non-fatal stroke and CV related death comprising the primary endpoint. The primary null
      hypothesis of efficacy is that time to first CV event among African American patients with a
      positive LTA4H HapK Variant assay test is no different from placebo when either is given in
      addition to standard of care therapy. A total of 3450 eligible patients will be randomized in
      this study.

      The treatment duration for patients enrolled in the study will be a target of at least 6
      months (based on approximate time of last patient enrolled) and up to 36 months (from first
      patient enrolled). All cardiac clinical events endpoints will be adjudicated by an
      independent Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC).

    ",Selenium in Mild Thyroid Eye Disease in North America,Thyroid Associated Ophthalmopathies,"['Eye Diseases', 'Graves Ophthalmopathy', 'Thyroid Diseases']","
      Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a disease in which the soft tissues surrounding the eye can
      become inflamed, scarred, and at times permanently damaged in an autoimmune reaction highly
      associated with abnormal thyroid hormone levels. Some patients have much more severe TED than
      others, but overall, most patients reach a point with relatively stable TED after 1 to 2
      years. A recent European study showed that oral selenium, a trace mineral involved in
      anti-oxidation and immune regulation, could actually alter the course of mild TED, lessening
      its signs and symptoms and even improving the quality of life of those who took it. The
      investigators would like to perform a sister study throughout North America. In this
      randomized, double-blinded, multi-center trial, some subjects with mild TED would be given
      100 micrograms of sodium selenite twice a day; others would receive a placebo. Signs,
      symptoms, and quality of life would be measured at regular intervals throughout the 6 month
      period of drug administration, and for 6 months thereafter.

      Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States. The
      overall rate of ESRD secondary to diabetes has risen 68% since 1992. Medications that block
      the renin angiotensin system have been shown to decrease the progression of diabetic
      nephropathy. The use of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) has been shown to decrease the
      risk of progression of kidney disease in two studies of individuals with Type 2 diabetes and
      proteinuria. Despite the use of an ARB, the incidence of renal failure remained high in the
      treated group in both studies. The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor
      (ACEI) and ARB can lead to more complete blockade of the renin angiotensin system. In
      diabetic kidney disease, combination therapy has been shown to decrease proteinuria in
      short-term studies. Although there are encouraging results for improvement in proteinuria
      there are no data on progression of kidney disease for the use of combination of ACEI and ARB
      therapy in patients with diabetes. In addition, there could be an increased risk of serious
      hyperkalemia in individuals with diabetes who receive combination ACEI and ARB. The
      investigators therefore propose a randomized double blind multi-center clinical trial to
      assess the effect of combination of ACEI and ARB in patients with diabetes and proteinuria on
      progression of kidney disease.

      Study Abstract:

      The study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, parallel group trial to test the
      efficacy of the combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) with an
      angiotension receptor blocker (ARB) vs. standard treatment with angiotension receptor blocker
      on the combined end-point. The primary outcome is a composite endpoint of reduction in
      estimated GFR of 30 ml/min/1.73m*m in individuals with an estimated GFR greater than or equal
      to 60 ml/min/1.73m*m; reduction in estimated GFR of greater than 50% in individuals with an
      estimated GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73m*m; progression to end-stage renal disease (defined as
      need for dialysis, renal transplant or en eGFR less than 15 ml/min/1.73m*m)or death. The
      study population is individuals with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy.

      Eligible subjects who consent to participate will be randomized into either the combination
      therapy arm or the mono therapy arm. The randomization will be stratified by site and within
      sites by baseline albuminuria (< 1 vs. greater than or equal to 1 gram/gram creatinine) and
      eGFR (< 60 vs. greater than or equal to 60 ml/min/1.73m*m). All participants will receive
      open label therapy with losartan, an ARB, as standard of care. Patients not treated with an
      ACEI or ARB will be initiated on losartan; patients treated with an ACEI or ARB other than
      losartan (the study ARB) will be converted to losartan (the study ARB) and the dose titrated
      to 100 mg/day. Individuals who tolerate ARB 100mg/day criteria will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to the addition of blinded lisinopril (the study ACEI) or placebo. The medication
      (lisinopril or placebo) will be titrated from an initial dose of 10 mg/day to a target dose
      of 40 mg/day. After each adjustment in dose, serum chemistries will be evaluated for kidney
      function and potassium levels. Subjects will be enrolled over a period of 4.25 years and the
      maximum length of follow-up is 6.25 years. The planned study duration is 6.25 years with 4.25
      years of accrual and 6.25 years of follow-up for all enrolled patients. The intervention was
      stopped on November 7, 2012 for safety concerns after an interim analysis. Patients are still
      under passively follow-up without intervention.

      RATIONALE: Mycophenolate mofetil added to immunosuppressive treatment regimens may be
      effective in treating newly diagnosed chronic graft-versus-host disease caused by stem cell
      transplantation. It is not yet known whether immunosuppressive treatment regimens are more
      effective with or without mycophenolate mofetil in treating chronic graft-versus-host
      disease.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying whether the addition of mycophenolate
      mofetil improves the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment regimens in patients with newly
      diagnosed chronic graft-versus-host disease.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment regimens with vs without
           mycophenolate mofetil in patients with newly diagnosed chronic graft-vs-host disease.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective, multicenter
      study. Patients are stratified according to organ involvement of chronic graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) (single organ vs multiple organs) and transplant center. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients receive usual therapy for chronic GVHD comprising oral prednisone twice daily
      and oral cyclosporine, oral tacrolimus or oral sirolimus twice daily until 2 weeks after the
      first evidence of improvement of symptoms of chronic GVHD.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms administration of the
           study drug continues for 3 months after completion of prednisone and cyclosporine,
           tacrolimus or sirolimus in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3-5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 patients (115 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.

      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) are medical conditions
      that occur when there is severe inflammation and increased fluids in both lungs, making it
      difficult for the lungs to function properly. Hospital treatment for a person with ALI/ARDS
      often includes the use of a breathing machine, or ventilator, until the person is able to
      breathe without assistance. Initiating proper nutrition through a feeding tube early in a
      person's hospital stay may help to improve recovery, but the optimal timing, composition, and
      amount of feeding treatments are unknown. This study will evaluate whether early or delayed
      full-calorie feeding through a feeding tube is more effective in reducing recovery time and
      increasing survival rates in people with ALI/ARDS. The study will also determine whether
      supplementing the feedings with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants benefits people with
      ALI/ARDS.
    ",Early Versus Delayed Enteral Feeding and Omega-3 Fatty Acid/Antioxidant Supplementation for Treating People With Acute Lung Injury or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (The EDEN-Omega Study),"Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult","['Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Lung Injury', 'Syndrome']","
      ALI/ARDS involves extensive inflammation in the lungs that can lead to rapid respiratory
      failure. These conditions are most commonly caused by pneumonia, generalized infection, or
      severe trauma to the lungs, but can also be less commonly caused by smoke or salt water
      inhalation, drug overdose, or shock.

      For some people, ALI/ARDS resolves without treatment, but many severe cases result in
      hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU), where 30% to 40% of cases end in mortality.
      Current treatments for ALI/ARDS include assisted breathing with a ventilator, supportive
      care, and management of the underlying causes. Enteral feeding, in which patients receive
      nutrition through a feeding tube, plays an important role in treatment, too. Some recent
      studies have shown that, compared to delayed feeding, enteral feeding initiated soon after a
      patient begins assisted breathing is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a better
      chance of survival. However, other studies show the opposite, and studies on optimal feeding
      volume and composition have conflicting results. Studies have also indicated that enhancing
      enteral feeding with omega-3 fatty acid and antioxidant supplements may help reduce lung
      inflammation, improving overall recovery rates. This study will evaluate the effects of early
      versus delayed full-calorie enteral feeding on mortality, ventilator-free days, ICU-free
      days, and organ failure in people with ALI/ARDS. The study will also determine whether
      supplementation with omega-3 fatty acid and antioxidants adds any beneficial effect.

      Upon admission to the ICU, a dietary evaluation will be done on each participant to determine
      goal, or full-calorie, feeding rates, which will be based on body weight and daily energy
      consumption. Participants will also undergo baseline assessments and procedures, which will
      include vital sign measurements, blood draws, a frontal chest radiograph, ventilator
      settings, and placement of feeding tube. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      initial enteral feedings that are either minimal (trophic) or full-calorie. They will also be
      randomly assigned to receive either omega-3 fatty acid and antioxidant supplementation or
      placebo. All participants will begin enteral feeding within 6 hours of treatment assignment.

      Participants assigned to initial minimal enteral feedings will receive feedings at 10 cubic
      centimeters (cc) per hour, to be continued at this rate for 144 hours, provided that the
      participant remains on the ventilator. After the 144 hours, the feeding rate will be advanced
      to full-calorie rates.

      Participants assigned to initial full-calorie enteral feedings will receive feedings at 25 cc
      per hour, and the feeding rate will be increased by 25 cc per hour every 6 hours until goal
      rate is reached. During enteral feedings, gastric residual volumes (GRVs) will be checked
      every 6 to 12 hours to assure acceptable levels. Participants will complete enteral feedings
      upon hospital discharge, Day 28 of treatment, death, or ability to achieve 48 hours of
      unassisted breathing. Omega-3 fatty acid, antioxidant, and placebo supplements will be
      administered with a syringe into the participant's feeding tube every 12 hours until Day 21
      or discontinuation of the ventilator.

      Blood pressure, heart rate, ventilation settings, and various blood factors will be measured
      during treatment. Phone-based follow-up assessments will occur at Months 6 and 12 after ICU
      discharge and will include measurements of health-related quality of life; psychological,
      neurocognitive, and physical activity outcomes; healthcare utilization; and mortality.

      The objective of this study is to establish the efficacy of tPA when used in pediatric
      intra-abdominal abscesses immediately after percutaneous drainage, irrespective of the
      ultrasound appearance or consistency of the drained fluid.
    ",Safety and Efficacy of the Use of Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) in Intra-Abdominal Collections in Children - A Prospective Study,Intra-abdominal Abscess,"['Abscess', 'Abdominal Abscess']","
      The use of tPA in pediatric abdominal abscesses is poorly defined. The indications are
      somewhat subjective and the dosage guidelines vary between institutions. Some studies have
      suggested that it be administered at, or soon after, the time of drainage if the ultrasound
      appearance of the collection is complex and/or septated, or if the initial aspirated contents
      are thick and viscous. Both criteria are difficult to accurately define and implement. In
      many instances, when there is minimal ongoing drainage despite follow-up ultrasound
      appearances suggesting a significant residual collection, tPA is administered several days
      following the initial procedure.

      The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy of tPA in the initial treatment of all
      pediatric intra-abdominal abcesses and a standardized manner in which it can be used. This
      may eventually lead to a change in practice in the management of this patient population.

      Vitamin D deficiency is common in cystic fibrosis. Vitamin D deficiency frequently persists
      despite aggressive treatment with ergocalciferol, a vitamin D preparation also known as
      vitamin D2. Cholecalciferol, a vitamin D preparation also known as vitamin D3,may work better
      to increase vitamin D levels.

      Vitamin D is important for absorption of calcium from the diet and bone health. Vitamin D
      more recently has been found to play a role in regulating the normal inflammatory process.
      Since cystic fibrosis is a state of excessive inflammation, vitamin D may be playing a role
      in cystic fibrosis.

      We hypothesize: cholecalciferol will work better to increase vitamin D levels in patients
      iwth cystic fibrosis and that it will have an effect on markers of inflammation.
    ",Vitamin D3 for the Treatment of Low Vitamin D in Cystic Fibrosis,"['Cystic Fibrosis', 'Vitamin D Deficiency']","['Cystic Fibrosis', 'Vitamin D Deficiency', 'Fibrosis']","
      Vitamin D deficiency is common in cystic fibrosis (CF) and persists despite relatively high
      doses of ergocalciferol, vitamin D2. Replacement has traditionally been focused upon
      maintenance of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and bone health. However, non-classic roles
      of vitamin D have become increasingly recognized and the contribution of vitamin D deficiency
      to non-bone disorders has become apparent. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with
      increased risk of a variety of cancers, autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes and
      multiple sclerosis, Type 2 diabetes, tuberculosis, and myopathy. The connection between
      vitamin D and these disease states likely reflects vitamin D's role as a transcriptional
      regulator: it participates in cell cycle regulation and in the innate immune system mediates
      cathelicidin production following activation of toll-like receptors.One hallmark of CF is
      pulmonary hyper-inflammation with recurrent infections. Additionally, malnutrition and
      decreased lean muscle mass threaten pulmonary function in CF. While vitamin D and its
      relation to bone has been explored in CF, the role of vitamin D in inflammation, lean body
      mass and strength, and pulmonary muscle strength has not been investigated. Moreover, vitamin
      D replacement has traditionally been with ergocalciferol, vitamin D2. Vitamin D3,
      cholecalciferol, has a longer half-life and is considered more potent. Thus, cholecalciferol
      treatment of children and young adults with CF and vitamin D deficiency may be useful for
      attaining normal vitamin D status and for exploring the impact of vitamin D upon lean body
      mass, pulmonary muscle strength, and inflammation.

    ",Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Kalinox® 170 Bar for the Performance of Care Procedures in Children With Burns,Burns,Burns,"
      Pain due to burns is one of the most intense and persistent types of pain. This pain consists
      of a permanent background pain, overlaid by episodes of temporary exacerbations triggered by
      treatment procedures or burn-care procedures.

      Care procedures, such as changing the dressings or cleaning the wounds, make it necessary to
      handle the painful areas, and this causes transient intense pain.

      Analgesia with a 50/50 mix of nitrous oxide and oxygen is a simple and effective technique,
      which induces a state of light sedation during which verbal contact is not lost, which is
      rapidly reversible and is devoid of any major side effects. This gas is used in paediatrics
      for carrying out painful procedures of a short duration, such as lumbar puncture and minor
      surgery.

      The nitrous oxide/oxygen mix has also been used to treat the pain induced by care procedures
      in children with burns for more than 30 years.

      Atrial Flutter [AFL] is a relatively frequent arrhythmia, considered as benign, but
      associated with both invalidating symptoms and thromboembolic risk. The objective of the
      treatment consists to on the one hand the sinus rhythm [SR] restoration and on the other hand
      the prevention of the long-term recurrence. In this clinical setting, AFL radiofrequency
      ablation [RFA] became the first line therapy due to its both high effectiveness and safety.
      The effectiveness of AFL RFA is attenuated by the subsequent risk of atrial fibrillation
      [AFib] close to 25% at 1 year. This risk of subsequent AFib is related to the common
      substrate between both arrhythmias.

      When AFib occurs, the interest to maintain the SR is still required, even if recent studies
      did not show a significant difference in term of total mortality between rate or rhythm
      control strategies [AFFIRM, RACE and PIAF studies]. The studies published underlined the
      anti-arrhythmic drugs limits in patients with both arrhythmias [AFib and AFL]. After years
      centered on the mechanisms and the electric treatments of AFib, researchers are nowadays
      focusing on the study's evaluation of the atrial tissue substrate.

      Accordingly, the renin-angiotensin system role was investigated in many works. Indeed,
      angiotensin II plays a role in the modification of atrial pressure and in the fibers
      stretching [""stretch""], conditions required for the development of AFib. Angiotensin II is
      also a factor implied in the tissue fibrosis leading to tissue proliferation and collagen
      alteration. These mechanisms lead to atria cells conduction disorders and refractory periods
      modification. Moreover, the enzyme of conversion expression and the angiotensin II receptors
      deterioration were observed in patients with AFib.

      This brings to the concept of AFib treatment while interfering on tissue remodeling by the
      way of renin-angiotensin system. Drugs such as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition
      [ACEI] may reduce AFib in patients with heart failure. No randomized study so far has
      compared the ACEI drugs against placebo among high-risk patients of AFib in post AFL RFA
      area. On the basis of experimental and clinical study, the investigators seek to evaluate the
      ACEI use in the prevention of AFib in an AFL post RFA ablation.

      The PROGRESS is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomized, trial comparing
      anticoagulation, which is the currently most frequently used treatment, alone, versus
      transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) combined with anticoagulation, in
      patients presenting with recent obstructive portal vein thrombosis (ROPVT). The rationale of
      this study is to significantly increase the proportion of patients that achieve a complete or
      partial recanalization of the portal vein. The intervention of this study consists in TIPS
      deployment and catheter based clot removal in addition to anticoagulation. The investigators
      retain that this intervention will increase the proportion of patients with an open portal
      vein from 38% with anticoagulation alone to 83% with anticoagulation and TIPS after 6 months.
      Both anticoagulant therapy and clot removal/TIPS are treatments that are currently available
      and accepted indications for the treatment of ROPVT. Anticoagulation will be performed with
      unfractioned heparin or low molecular weight heparin initially and with vitamin K antagonists
      in the long term. The investigators plan to collect blood for biobanking at the time of
      inclusion and after 6 months. Blood samples for a biobank will be collected.

      The occurrence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (SBO) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered to be a chronic pulmonary graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) that is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. The reported incidence of
      SBO varies from 6 to 26% of allogeneic HSC recipients and is usually diagnosed within 2 years
      after transplantation. The diagnosis of SBO relies on the occurrence of a new airflow
      obstruction identified during pulmonary function testing, and the definition differs between
      studies. Currently, no curative immunosuppressive treatment is available, and recent data
      suggest that the use of these treatments, especially corticosteroids, should be limited
      because of their toxicity. The impairment of lung function parameters is likely caused by
      fibrous small airway lesions. Few data on the pathogenesis of SBO after allogeneic HSCT are
      available. Several hypotheses are based on the occurrence of SBO during chronic graft
      rejection after lung transplantation, which shares many clinical and histopathological
      similarities with SBO after allogeneic HSCT. One hypothesis is that the first step leading to
      SBO is lung epithelium injury. SBO is then identified as an alloimmune reaction with only one
      clearly identified risk factor: extrathoracic chronic GVHD. Due to their anti-inflammatory
      and immunomodulatory properties, recent data suggest that low-dose macrolides may be
      effective at preventing SBO after lung transplants. This well-tolerated treatment may be
      useful for preventing SBO after allogeneic HSCT.

      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow that mostly affects older adults.
      Even with the best chemotherapy, two-year disease-free survival is achieved in a minority of
      patients. Bone marrow transplantation from a sibling donor may improve cure rates; however,
      patients over 50 years of age have a high risk of complications and therefore generally are
      excluded from this treatment option. Recently our group developed a transplantation strategy
      for older cancer patients that protects against transplant-associated complications, yet does
      not interfere with the ability of the transplanted donor cells to destroy cancer cells. With
      this new method, we can now safely evaluate transplantation as a curative therapy for AML
      patients over the age of 50. We have assembled clinical and scientific researchers throughout
      the state of California to study and compare bone marrow transplantation using our new
      approach with the best standard of care chemotherapy in AML patients over the age of 50. The
      results of this study have the potential to establish a new treatment standard that will
      improve survival of older AML patients.

      SARS-CoV-2 is a member of a class of viruses: angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding
      viruses that study calls ""ABVs"". The World Health Organization (WHO) and others are
      performing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vaccines and novel antivirals to address
      SARS-CoV-2 directly. However, the critical illness complications of COVID-19 are caused in
      part by SARS-CoV-2's binding and inhibiting ACE2 and the consequent host response.

      ACE 2 is the receptor for H1N1, H5N1, and SARS-CoV-2. After binding ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 is
      endocytosed, and surface ACE2 is down-regulated, increasing angiotensin II (ATII a potent
      vasoconstrictor) in COVID-19. The original ARBs limits lung injury in murine influenza H7N9
      and decreases viral titre and RNA.

      Study has a unique opportunity to complement vaccine and anti-viral RCTs with an RCT
      modulating the host response using an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARBs) to
      decrease the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patient.
    ",Host Response Mediators in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Infection - Is There a Protective Effect of Losartan and Other ARBs on Outcomes of Coronavirus Infection?,"['Covid19', 'SARS-CoV Infection']","['Infections', 'Communicable Diseases', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus Infections', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome']","
      PURPOSE: There is clinical equipoise around the safety and efficacy of ARBs in COVID-19, but
      there are few RCTs of ARBs in COVID-19. Guo and colleagues' meta-analysis showed that
      ARBs/ACE inhibitor use was associated with decreased mortality. Our structured literature
      review (Cheng et al., submitted) shows that SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses that bind ACE2 cause
      acute cardiac injury in nearly 50% of cases. Safety concerns of ARBs in COVID-19 arise
      because ARBs increase cardiac ACE2, potentially increasing SARS-CoV-2 cellular uptake and
      worsening outcomes. On the other hand, ARBs block the effects of excess angiotensin II and
      could be beneficial. Our proposed ARBs CORONA II Phase 3 RCT will establish whether ARBs can
      decrease mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      Primary - ARBs (losartan, valsartan, azilsartan, candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan,
      olmesartan, telmisartan) decreases mortality and are safe in hospitalized COVID-19 infected
      adults compared to standard of care.

      Secondary - ACE pathway proteins (ATI, AT1-7, ATII, ACE and ACE2 levels), cytokines and
      metabolomics/proteomics predict mortality and efficacy of ARBs in hospitalized COVID19
      adults.

      RESEARCH DESIGN: Study will assess ARBs (losartan, valsartan, azilsartan, candesartan,
      eprosartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, telmisartan) (see 6.3 Intervention for more) vs. usual
      care for safety and efficacy in decreasing organ dysfunction and mortality of hospitalized
      adults with COVID-19. Dr. Srinivas Murthy and Dr Rob Fowler, co-investigators herein and PIs
      of the CATCO RCT in Canada, Dr. John Marshall, co-investigator herein and PI of REMAPCAP, and

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of
      tapentadol hydrochloride prolonged release in subjects suffering from severe chronic low back
      pain (LBP) who are taking WHO Step III analgesics and show lack of tolerability. This is a
      clinical effectiveness trial designed to establish a link between anticipated clinical
      outcomes and the clinical practice by means of selected measures of clinical and
      subject-reported outcome.

      The trial will compare the effectiveness of previous analgesic treatment (WHO Step III) with
      that of tapentadol hydrochloride prolonged release treatment during defined periods of
      evaluation.

      The investigators will quantify inflammatory biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
      serum of children with hydrocephalus who are undergoing ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement
      under isoflurane anesthesia.
    ",Isoflurane-induced Neuroinflammation in Children With Hydrocephalus,"['Toxicity', 'Hydrocephalus']","['Hydrocephalus', 'Neuroinflammatory Diseases']","
      Background & Significance. Each year, millions of children receive general anesthesia.
      Isoflurane, a GABA type A (GABAA) receptor agonist is an inhaled anesthetic commonly used in
      clinical anesthesia practice worldwide. Anesthetics traditionally have been assumed to be
      safe as long as severe hypotension and hypoxia are avoided. Interfering with the balance of
      excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the developing brain may interfere with the
      formation of synaptic connections and enhance the normal apoptotic processes that lead to
      neuronal pruning and may induce neuroinflammation. Such enhanced neuronal pruning and
      neuroinflammation could lead to excessive neuronal loss at critical times during brain
      development and consequently cause later learning disabilities. Recent reports of
      neurotoxicity induced with isoflurane have triggered significant concern about the safety of
      this agent.

      Investigations into neuroinflammation and apoptosis after anesthetic exposure in human
      children have been limited due to ethical and methodological concerns. Studies that have been
      done have been largely retrospective, population-based studies. Results from these studies
      have been mixed, some showing a decline in neurocognitive performance, some showing no
      change. Further, the vast majority of prospective, hypothesis-driven research has been
      undertaken in animal models. Developing a clinically relevant animal model and testing
      resultant hypotheses in humans are critical steps in determining the underlying cause of
      these changes as well as identifying possible therapeutic targets. The investigators
      hypothesize that piglets exposed to commonly used anesthetics will exhibit increased
      neuroinflammation when compared with controls. It is further hypothesized children undergoing
      neurosurgery with isoflurane anesthesia will show evidence of increased central nervous
      system inflammation. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that significantly less robust
      inflammation will be seen in patients undergoing MRI with general anesthesia (no surgery),
      indicating a role of surgical stress in the modulation of isoflurane-induced
      neuroinflammation.

      Clinical/Translational Investigation (NCH): Surgery Group. Patients aged 0-5 years undergoing
      general anesthesia for ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) repair will have CSF and serum
      sampled at the beginning of surgery (after induction but before surgical incision) and at the
      end of surgery (after closure but before emergence). Each of these patients will be
      randomized to a standardized anesthetic. An additional CSF sample will be taken prior to post
      anesthesia care unit (PACU) discharge. These samples will be analyzed as described above.
      Control Group. Patients undergoing diagnostic MRI under general anesthesia for non-neurologic
      pathology will receive a standardized anesthetic. Serum will be collected at the beginning
      and end of the procedure and will be analyzed for inflammation as above.

      Short term goals: Demonstrate that isoflurane has a role in modulation of neuroinflammation
      in humans. Determine if surgical stress also has a role in modulation of this inflammation.
      Develop a clinically relevant animal model for hypothesis-driven anesthetic neuroinflammation
      research.

      Long term goals: Identify which anesthetic regimens, if any, are safe for use in the
      developing brain. Identify therapeutic targets for prevention or treatment of
      anesthetic-induced neuroinflammation. Obtain independent federal funding for future research
      and establish an experimental neuroscience program on the Nationwide Children's campus.

      Current treatment for acutely suicidal patients are limited to hospitalization,
      psychotherapy, electro-convulsant therapy, or a combination of the aforementioned. However,
      this has added to the national boarding problem. Long term pharmacologic treatment for
      suicidal behaviors and mood stabilization has been studied in specific populations. In these
      populations, the decreases in suicidal ideation results from stabilization of the underlying
      psychiatric illness. Ketamine is most commonly used as an anesthetic with analgesic
      properties. It has been used off-label for pain management, procedural sedation, status
      epilepticus, and treatment resistant depression. It has been safely administered
      intravenously and well tolerated for chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It increases
      norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin through adrenergic neuron stimulation and prevention
      of catecholamine uptake. There is a strong corollary between stress and the development of
      depression and suicidal behaviors. It is proposed that the use of low dose intravenous
      ketamine may have benefit on the suicidal ideation of patients presenting to the Emergency
      Department.
    ",Initiating Ketamine in Acutely Suicidal Patients in the Emergency Department,"['Suicide', 'Suicide Threat', 'Depression Severe']","['Emergencies', 'Suicide']","
      There is a strong corollary between stress and the development of depression and suicidal
      behaviors. The neurobiological mediators of stress are primarily controlled by the
      noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) median eminence systems. Furthermore,
      stress directly and indirectly, through the Hypothalamic Pituitary Axis, activates the Locus
      Coeruleus (LC), which is the primary producer of NE in the central nervous system (CNS).
      Directly, glutaminergic neurons send excitatory signals to the LC via interaction with
      N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, can dampen the
      glutaminergic system, which has been implicated during states of depression and low moods.

      The neurobiological commonality between multiple psychiatric disorders and depression,
      suicide, and attempted suicide is a decrease in serotonergic activity. It has been shown that
      patients who died of suicide, have decreased serotonin transporter in the ventromedial
      prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate, which are areas that control decision making or
      willful action. The prefrontal cortex is important for inhibitory behavioral control. A
      potential treatment modality of ketamine, is that it produces activation of this region.35
      The anterior cingulate cortex has been shown to be associated with impulsive aggression
      compared to control. Clinical studies have shown that low CSF 5-HIAA, metabolite in serotonin
      system, has been implicated and positively correlated to aggression scores and impulsivity.
      This is interesting because, suicides in the military are thought to have an impulsivity
      component, triggered by one or more major life stressors.

      Another region associated with suicide is the infralimbic cortex. A recent study, based on
      neuroimaging techniques, demonstrated that glucose metabolism in this region was associated
      with SI at baseline, and decreases in SI was observed after ketamine infusion. This is the
      same region target by deep brain stimulation, for depression treatment. Additionally, the
      infralimbic cortex has been implicated in behavioral flexibility. Implicating that ketamine's
      anti-suicidal properties may stem from its ability to promoting cognitive flexibility. Most
      likely due to its ability to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a
      major contributor to neuronal plasticity. BDNF also plays key roles in synaptic and long-term
      potentiation, which may counteract the decreased levels in Mood Disorder (MDD) patients.
      Furthermore, ketamine infusion has been shown to change sleep slow wave activity. This
      biomarker is functionally related to increased synaptic strengthening and cortical
      synchronization. These factors, combined, may be implicated in not only ketamine's
      antidepressant effects and counteraction of decreased synaptic plasticity seen mood
      disorders, but also its ability to have week long lasting effects.

      This information leads us to hypothesize that treatment of acutely suicidal patients with
      ketamine would: 1) decrease suicidal ideationto a clinically significant degree, and 2) the
      effect of ketamine will be seen for as long as one-week post administration.

      To the best of our knowledge, this study does not duplicate any ongoing work. Instead, it
      would strengthen power to past studies and current work. There are four clinical trials
      investigating ketamine's effect on SI. One has an unknown status. There are two that are
      investigating ketamine in relationship to psychiatric standard of care, whereas this study is
      investigating its effects against a saline placebo. Finally, the last clinical trial is
      investigating the Neurobiology of Suicide. Their phase 2 component, which utilizes a similar
      protocol, uses ketamine as a tool to identify potential biomarkers for suicide. Furthermore,
      this study differs from Janssen Research & Development's clinical trial in administration
      route and study design. Their study focuses on using ketamine through intranasal
      administration. Their primary outcomes are the long-term safety and efficacy, and the design
      of their study is an open label multicenter trial.

      This research does not duplicate any prior work. To date, there is only one study, from Iran,
      that evaluates the effectiveness of ketamine in high risk patients, or those that present as
      acutely suicidal to the ED. This was a single blinded trial that utilized 0.2mg/kg infused
      over one minute. The study indicated significant decrease in their measurement outcomes.
      However, they concluded that ketamine is not a good choice for treatment because it did not
      meet their cut off values. Their results might have been influenced by the rapid infusion
      over one minute, which differs from our study as well as the vast majority of the literature.
      We believe the slower 40-minute infusion is necessary for optimal results, as the larger
      dosage has produced more clinically meaningful results in prior studies, and the slower
      infusion produced less negative side effects. They chose the minimal dose shown to diminish
      SI41 200 ng/ml (0.2 mg/kg), which provokes lateral nystagmus.35 This protocol utilizes a
      higher dose, 0.5 mg/kg, which is the ED50 for narcosis. Our study is medically relevant
      because dosage effects on SI have not been studied. Comparison of our studies may address
      questions regarding the optimal dose and infusion rate.

      The BSSI will measure the severity of SI. It is based on the interviewer rated version of the
      original Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), which is one of the few document suicide
      assessment tools with predictive validity for suicide completion. The internal reliability,
      test and retest validity, as well as invariance over time has been demonstrated for the BSS.
      Furthermore, the first five items of the BSSI are a common clinical screening for the
      presence of suicidal thoughts. For these reasons, the BSSI was chosen as our primary outcomes
      measure. Two studies have indicated that the cut off between high and low risk is a BSS ≥ 2.
      A recent investigation has determined BSSI ≥ 6 is predictive of future suicide attempts.
      These two values will serve in our analysis.

      The Montgomery- Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a widely known 10 item clinician
      administered measure of depression severity. Since it's development in the late 1970s, it has
      become more popular than the gold standard, Hamilton rating scale for Depression (HAM-D). It
      is considered to be more sensitive to change, just as effective, and simpler to use
      clinically. However, the reliability depends on good interrater agreement. Difficulties in
      clinical trial to show signal detection for known effective drugs have implicated clinician
      administered measurement as a possible source of error. To avoid poor interrater reliability,
      rater bias, and variable interview quality, this trial will utilize the self-administered
      version of the MADRS-S. This has 9 items and a total score ranging from 0 to 27.50 The
      scoring of MADRS-S has shown to be similar to that of physician scoring.

      The emotional pain of the suicidal patient requires empathetic care that may not always be
      possible with the time pressures, volume, and pragmatic nature of the ED environment. A
      pharmacologic intervention with rapid effects to decrease SI would play a vital role in
      improving the standard of care for this vulnerable population.

      The study objective was to evaluate the effect of atrasentan compared with placebo on time to
      doubling of serum creatinine (DBSC) or the onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in
      participants with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy who were treated with the maximum tolerated

      This was a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, double-blind, enriched-population, placebo
      controlled, multicenter study in adult participants with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.
      Participants who met the inclusion criteria for initial study entry and none of the exclusion
      criteria were eligible to proceed to the Run-In Period to optimize RAS inhibitor and diuretic
      doses. Following the Run-In Period, eligible participants entered the 6-week Enrichment

      The investigators aim to study if patients that undergo catheter ablation for ventricular
      tachycardia benefit from continuation of Vaughan-Williams class III antiarrhythmic drugs for
      3 months after their ablation.
    ",Continuation of Antiarrhythmics Following Ventricular Tachycardia Catheter Ablation,"['Tachycardia, Ventricular', 'Catheter Ablation']","['Tachycardia', 'Tachycardia, Ventricular']","
      Catheter ablation is a valuable option to control recurrent Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) in
      patients with structural heart disease. A recent trial proved that catheter ablation is
      superior to escalation of anti arrhythmic drugs (AADs) in prevention of VT recurrence and
      death (Sapp et al. N Engl J Med 2016; 375:111-121). However, even with ablation,
      approximately 20-50% of patients will have an episode of VT within one year. This is probably
      explained in part by the substrate (myocardial scar from cardiomyopathy) persists after VT
      ablation and that ablation lesions heal and evolve over days, weeks and even months. Most
      patients (if not all) of patients who undergo ablation are on AADs and usually have failed at
      least one of them. Furthermore, most AADs, and Vaughan Williams class III AADs in particular
      (the most frequently used to treat VT) carry significant and life-threatening side effects
      from pulmonary, hepatic and hematologic toxicities up to significant ventricular arrhythmias
      and death. Since these patients have already failed AADs, and the significant adverse profile
      of AADs, there is no evidence that the benefits of continuation of these drugs will surpass
      the risks after ablation. Therefore the investigators decided to ask the question:

      Among patients with structural heart disease who undergo VT ablation, does continuation of
      class III AADs for 3 months, increases VT-free survival compared to discontinuation of
      antiarrhythmic drug therapy?

      Based on expert consensus about clinical equipoise in regards of AAD continuation after VT
      ablation, the investigators decided to select patients with lowest risk of VT recurrence
      after ablation as our study population. The investigators aim to include in our study only
      those patients who have an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD), who have NO
      inducible VT at the end of the ablation procedure and also who have NO inducible VT prior to
      discharge on a procedure called non-invasive programmed stimulation (NIPS). It has been shown
      that patients with inducible VT at the end of ablation and during NIPS have significantly
      higher risk of VT recurrence compared to those in whom VT was not induced. In NIPS, one uses
      the previously Implanted ICD to pace the ventricle fast enough to try to induce VT. Both
      procedures will be performed as usual practice in patients who undergo VT ablation in the
      arrhythmia service.

      The specific aim of this pilot study is to evaluate whether the strategy of continuation of
      class III AADs following initial catheter ablation for VT, improves VT-free survival and
      reduces readmissions.

      17β-estradiol (E2) (MK-8342B) vaginal ring compared to placebo vaginal ring in the treatment
      of dysmenorrhea at Treatment Cycle 2. This study was also to assess the safety and
      tolerability of the ENG-E2 vaginal rings over 4 treatment cycles. Primary hypothesis:
      Relative to the placebo ring, the ENG-E2 vaginal ring results in a greater proportion of
      participants with a ≥3-point reduction in peak pelvic pain score and no increase in the
      number of rescue pain relief (ibuprofen) tablets taken at Treatment Cycle 2 as compared to

      began the day prior to initiation of each cyclic bleeding episode (spontaneous menses or
      hormone withdrawal bleeding) and continued until the third bleeding day (inclusive). An
      external committee of blinded independent reviewers was to determine the 4-day cramping
      window for each participant so that analysis of the efficacy data could be conducted. The
      study was terminated early due to a business decision by the Sponsor to discontinue product
      development for reasons unrelated to safety or efficacy outcomes. Due to the early study
      termination, the blinded independent review committee that was supposed to determine the
      4-day cramping windows for data analysis was not assembled; thus cramping windows were not
      determined. Without defined cramping windows, the efficacy outcome measures for this study

      The current standard treatment for Old World CL is based on daily painful injections with
      antimonials, which in Pakistan requires specialised care provided in secondary level care
      facilities.

      Apart from potential toxic side effects of these antimonials, the long treatment course, high
      cost and inconvenience, it may prevent patients from seeking care or completing treatment,
      especially women and children in the Pakistan context. Untreated cutaneous leishmaniasis may
      leave disfiguring scars leading to stigmatisation and (psycho) social problems. If the CL
      lesions/scars are located on joints they can cause problems in motion and lead to disability.
      At a public health level, patients with untreated CL lesions are a reservoir for further
      transmission of CL in the family and community.

      Thermotherapy is topical, not invasive, non-toxic, and the treatment duration is only 7 days,

      Patients on hemodialysis (HD) exhibit an immensely increased cardiovascular mortality
      associated with extensive vascular calcification (VC). In the past years the development of
      VC was discovered to be actively regulated and as being influenced by inhibitors of
      calcification (e.g. matrix-Gla-protein, fetuin-A). MGP is produced by vascular smooth muscle
      cells and needs post-translational modification by vitamin K dependent gamma-carboxylation to
      be fully active. Based on the demonstration of increased PIVKA-II levels, about 97% of all HD
      patients exhibit insufficient carboxylation activity. We therefore aim in this randomized,
      controlled study to retard the progress of coronary and aortal calcification as assessed by
      thoracic multislice-CT by the thrice weekly administration of 5 mg vitamin K1 (phylloquinone)
      to about 100 HD patients over a period of 18 months.
    ",Vitamin K1 to Slow Progression of Vascular Calcification in HD Patients,Cardiovascular Diseases,"['Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Vascular Calcification']","
      Patients on hemodialysis (HD) exhibit an immensely increased cardiovascular mortality
      associated with extensive vascular calcification (VC). This forms - at least partially - the
      reason for the excessively increased cardiovascular mortality in this population.

      In the past years the development of VC was discovered to be actively regulated and as being
      influenced by inhibitors of calcification (e.g. matrix-Gla-protein, fetuin-A). Matrix Gla
      protein (MGP) is a powerful vascular wall-based inhibitor of VC. MGP is produced by vascular
      smooth muscle cells and needs post-translational modification by vitamin K dependent
      gamma-carboxylation to be fully active. The role of MGP was discovered in knock-out mice,
      which died from rupture of a massively calcified aorta. Functional vitamin K deficiency
      induced by administration of warfarin leads to the development of VC, which in turn can be
      inhibited by subsequent administration of vitamin K1. Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K
      mediated gamma-carboxylation, which leads to the production of noncarboxylated and inactive
      MGP (ucMGP).

      Warfarin is widely used due to its inhibitory capacity on the activation of coagulation
      factors. Now it has been discovered that the use of vitamin K inhibitors influences vascular
      health: long-term use of warfarin is associated with an increased prevalence and extent of VC
      in the normal population and HD patients. Warfarin is also a crucial risk factor for the
      development of calciphylaxis, a life-threatening complication in HD patients characterised by
      calcified cutaneous vessels. In turn, administration of vitamin K1 was accompanied by reduced
      intima-media-thickness (IMT) and increased elasticity of vessels in postmenopausal women.

      Based on the demonstration of increased PIVKA-II levels, about 97% of all HD patients exhibit
      insufficient carboxylation activity. Together with the increased VC they represent an ideal
      population for interventional trials in the vitamin K system. Recently we were able to
      demonstrate that supplementation of vitamin K1 in such patients is well tolerated, shows only
      very few side effects and induces a dose dependent decrease of the inactive form
      Dephosphorylated noncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dpucMGP) in serum over a six weeks
      period. In this trial we also observed that all dialysis patients included had insufficient
      vitamin K serum levels, indicating no substantial influence of food intake on vitamin K
      deficiency. In addition, this demonstrates that all patients have insufficient vitamin K
      levels to facilitate adequate MGP carboxylation.

      aim is to assess the efficacy of Fermented Soy vs. placebo in 72 adults with prostate cancer.
      This study has 1 primary aim and 3 (1a thru 1c) sub aims. Aim 1 is to assess the effect of
      Fermented Soy (QC) on PSA (prostate specific antigen) In parallel, in Aims 1a-1c will assess
      tumor-specific effects of QC:

      Aim 1a: Identifying the anti-tumor effects of QC. This will be done by culturing multiple
      human cancer cell lines with QC at a range of concentrations, followed by readouts at
      different time points, of tumor cell apoptosis, proliferation, and senescence.

      Aim 1b: Identify a hierarchy of tumors that are responsive to QC. From the data in aim one an
      attempt will be made to identify a hierarchy of anti-tumor effects.

      Aim 1c: Investigate the signaling pathways in tumor cells that are modified by QC. To do
      this, full genomic profiling will be conducted for breast and prostate tumor cell lines, and
      will be done in conjunction with analysis of the relevant signaling pathways, and will
      include P53 and P21 activation pathways.

      In Canada each year, there are approximately 800 infants born between 28 and 32 weeks
      gestation. Up to 60% of these infants will require breathing tube placement for Respiratory
      Distress Syndrome or RDS. RDS is a lung disease of prematurity due to a lack of a compound
      called surfactant. The breathing tube is placed as a conduit for placing surfactant into the
      babies' lungs to improve the lung disease. Most babies are then placed on a breathing machine
      or ventilator. Ventilation is not without harm and can be associated with lung damage, delays
      in feeding, increased hospital stay and interruption of bonding. An alternative that does not
      require the presence of a breathing tube is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). We
      will randomize babies to either ventilation or CPAP to try to minimize the length of time the
      baby is kept on respiratory support.
    ",Will CPAP Reduce Length Of Respiratory Support In Premature Infants?,"['Prematurity', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn']","['Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn', 'Premature Birth']","
      Objectives: To determine whether infants 28 to 32 weeks gestational age with RDS treated with
      surfactant followed by CPAP have a shorter length of respiratory support (length of time on a
      ventilator and CPAP) than similar infants who are treated with MV after surfactant therapy;
      and to examine secondary outcomes including outcomes related to lung disease, feeding issues
      and hospital length of stay (secondary outcomes).

      Hypothesis: The use of CPAP after surfactant in infants born 28 to 32 weeks with RDS will
      reduce the length of respiratory support as compared with infants treated with MV. We
      hypothesize that the incidence of lung disease and feeding issues will be similar between
      groups while length of hospital stay will be shorter in the CPAP group.

      Methods: A multi-center, randomized trial conducted in seven neonatal intensive care units in
      Canada and France. Parents will be approached for consent prior to delivery or after the
      infant shows signs of RDS. Infants 28 to 32 weeks gestation with RDS will be eligible for the
      study. After intubation and surfactant administration, babies will be randomized to either
      receive CPAP or MV. Strict criteria for CPAP failure, weaning ventilation and weaning and
      discontinuing CPAP will be specified. Infants will be followed in the nursery until hospital
      discharge or until all outcomes have been determined.

      This is a study funded by the National Institute of Health. The rationale for the need of
      this research is the lack of any well proven risk-reducing intervention that may decrease the
      morbidity of lung cancer resection in patients with COPD or that may improve their quality of
      life trajectory, a meaningful outcome in the overall disease progression. The proposed
      intervention is unique as it combines exercise and behavioral interventions that were pilot
      tested in a randomized single-blinded controlled design in the proposed population and proved
      feasible and potentially effective. The aim is to test the effect of the proposed
      rehabilitation on length of stay, pulmonary complications and quality of life trajectory.

      pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) vs. standard care at a number of healthcare centers throughout
      the United States. This study will be open for 36 months. Randomization will be stratified by
      three variables: very severe lung function (yes vs. no), prior neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for
      this operation (yes vs. no) and open thoracotomy vs. video assisted thoracoscopy. The primary

      Specific Objectives:

      The study will have a prephase to evaluate the feasibility of the following randomized study
      (main phase).

      Pre-Phase (completed 2005) Primary Specific Objective:

      To determine the number of patients accountable per year for randomization in a worldwide
      study.

      Secondary Specific Objective:

      To measure the number of drop outs and to describe the toxicity of the chemotherapy.

      Main Phase (started in 2006) Primary Specific Objective:

      To compare the survival times after cyclophosphamide based treatment with the survival times
      after carboplatin based treatment in choroid plexus tumor patients.

      Main Phase Secondary Specific Objectives:

        1. To compare the resectability of choroid plexus tumors after two blocks of
           cyclophosphamide based treatment with the resectability after two blocks of carboplatin
           based treatment.

        2. To compare response rates of incompletely resected choroid plexus tumors to two blocks
           of cyclophosphamide based treatment with the response rates after two blocks of
           carboplatin based treatment.

        3. To determine the prognostic relevance of histological atypia and SV40 in choroid plexus
           tumors.
    ",Treatment of Tumors of the Choroid Plexus Epithelium,Choroid Plexus Tumors,Choroid Plexus Neoplasms,"
      Tumors of the choroid plexus epithelium are rare. Participants in this study will have
      surgery to remove as much of the brain tumor as possible. Taking as much of the tumor out
      during surgery is generally believed to have the best result for this disease. Some
      participants may even have a second surgery to remove more tumor if thought necessary.

      After the tumor surgery, exact treatment for each participant in this study will depend on
      how much of the tumor is removed during surgery and the way the tumor tissue looks under a
      microscope. Some participants will not require additional treatment because most or all of
      the tumor has been taken out. Those participants will still be on study, but they will only
      have observation and not receive additional treatment. Those that require additional
      treatment will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of 2 treatment groups
      with an equal chance of being assigned to either group.

      Chemotherapy (treatment with anti-cancer drugs) will be given as part of treatment for
      participants whose tumors are not completely removed surgically. Participants in one group
      will receive carboplatin plus etoposide, vincristine, and radiation therapy . Participants in
      the other group will receive cyclophosphamide plus etoposide, vincristine, and radiation
      therapy. Among all the known drugs for cancer, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and
      platinum drugs are the most effective against brain tumors. Carboplatin will be used because
      fewer side effects related to hearing should occur later on. This study also uses radiation
      therapy after surgery for children younger than 3 years old. Normally, chemotherapy has been
      used to delay radiation therapy until the child was older because of concerns about side
      effects. This change has been made because of the poor results achieved when chemotherapy was
      used to delay radiation therapy.

      Chemotherapy is the one and only additional treatment that participants under 3 years of age
      can receive in this study. After the first 2 cycles, response will be evaluated, including
      all exams done at screening before you continue on treatment, if needed. Further surgery will
      be considered after these exams. If both you and your doctor choose to consider further
      surgery and agree for the procedure to be the next appropriate step, you may undergo a second
      surgery to remove anymore remaining tumor. After the second surgery, the chemotherapy will be
      again continued on the same schedule for 4 more cycles. If you did not require further
      surgery, you will continue on with the chemotherapy as previously planned.

      For participants older than 3 years of age, radiation therapy will be a part of the
      treatment. It will be given after the second cycle of chemotherapy. Participants will receive
      radiation once per day, five days per week, over a period of about 6 weeks. Most of the
      participants do not need to stay in the hospital during this time. This will be followed by 6
      more cycles of chemotherapy. After 6 cycles of chemotherapy, further surgery will again be
      considered. While on radiation treatment, you will have blood (about 2 teaspoons) drawn for
      routine tests 2 times a week. Before and after the finish of radiation, another blood test
      (2-3 teaspoons) will be taken to monitor the kidney and liver function, as well as to measure
      levels of hormones. You will have a physical exam, and blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be
      drawn for routine tests before each cycle of treatment.

      Participants in the carboplatin group will receive etoposide over 1 hour on Days 1-5,
      carboplatin over 2 hours on Days 2 and 3, and vincristine over 15 minutes on Day 5. This will
      be repeated every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Each period of 4 weeks is considered 1 cycle of
      treatment.

      Participants in the cyclophosphamide group will receive etoposide over 1 hour on Days 1-5,
      cyclophosphamide over 1 hour on Days 2 and 3, and vincristine over 15 minutes on Day 5. This
      will be repeated every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (24 weeks) of treatment. Mesna, a drug to protect
      the bladder from the effects of cyclophosphamide, will be given 15 minutes before each dose
      of cyclophosphamide.

      The chemotherapy given in this study can cause your white blood cell count to be too low.
      White blood cells are infection-fighting cells. If the white blood cell count is low for too
      long, participants in both groups may be given a drug called G-CSF (filgrastim). Filgrastim
      is a growth factor naturally produced in the body to increase the production of white blood
      cells. Filgrastim will be given as a shot under the skin starting at Day 9 after starting the
      chemotherapy.

      The total length of treatment that you can receive will be 7 months, if you are able to
      complete all the cycles of the additional treatment. You will be taken off study if the
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur, and your doctor will discuss other
      treatment options with you.

      After completing treatment, there will be follow-up visits every 3 months for the first year.
      Every 6 months there will still be visits with the doctor until 4 years after completing
      treatment. You will continue to have follow-up visits every year after that to monitor for
      any signs of the disease coming back, or for as long as you would agree to allow follow-up
      visits. At each visit, you will have routine blood tests (about 2-3 teaspoons), checking of
      hormone levels, measurement of growth, and a hearing test. The effects of
      radiation/chemotherapy on your brain function, your ability to learn, and your quality of
      life will be measured. You will have a MRI of the brain, all known metastatic sites, and of
      the spine. Your body height and body weight will be measured. About 2 teaspoons of blood will
      be drawn for routine tests. Your urine will be tested for the presence of blood. You will
      have a spinal tap to look for cancer cells in the spinal fluid. Your hormone levels will also
      be taken to see if there are any signs of metabolic disorder and growth deficiency. This will
      be done with the other blood test and will not require any more extra blood samples from you.

      This is an investigational study. All of the drugs used in this study are FDA approved and
      are commercially available. Their use together in this study is experimental. A total of up
      to 100 patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 5 will be enrolled here at M.

      Background: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a highly effective therapy for acute
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Adjunctive therapy with glycoprotein (GP)
      IIb/IIIa inhibitor can result in increased patency and improved outcomes in STEMI patients,
      with thrombus, undergoing PCI. The investigation of novel dosing and delivery strategies of
      this therapy may help to further improve outcomes.

      Study design: Intracoronary Abciximab With Clearway Catheter trial is a randomized,
      open-label, multicenter, trial to evaluate the effect of an intracoronary (IC) bolus dose of
      abciximab delivered using the ClearWay™RX catheter versus an intravenous bolus (IV) of
      abciximab for STEMI with angiographically visible thrombus (Thrombus Grade > 2). All patients
      in both arms will receive intravenous abciximab infusion following the PCI for 12 hours per
      standard practice. A total of 150 patients will be randomized 1:1 to treatment of the culprit
      artery with IC abciximab (75 subjects) or IV abciximab (75 subjects) in addition to an
      infusion regimen of abciximab administered intravenously and initiated following PCI. The
      primary endpoint chosen to evaluate this hypothesis is infarct size as assessed on Cardiac
      Magnetic Resonance (CMR). Clinical outcomes will be assessed for each subject through
      hospital discharge and at 30 day follow-up.

      Sample size: The number of patients included in this study was based on the estimation of the
      sample size needed to identify a statistically significant difference of the primary
      end-points between the two groups. The investigators estimated that 75 patients would be
      required in each study group to have a power of 80% to detect an absolute difference in the
      infarct size resolution of 15% with a two-sided alpha value of 0.05.

      Conclusion: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that an IC bolus of abciximab
      delivered with the ClearWay™RX catheter added to a post-PCI intravenous infusion regimen of
      abciximab will result in significant additional clot resolution in vivo when compared with an
      IV bolus of abciximab when added to a post PCI intravenous infusion regimen of abciximab. The
      primary endpoint chosen to evaluate this hypothesis is infarct size as assessed on CMR.

      This randomized trial studies how well panitumumab, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil
      after combination chemotherapy and panitumumab induction work in treating patients with RAS
      wild type colorectal cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph
      nodes or other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as panitumumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving panitumumab, leucovorin
      calcium, and fluorouracil after combination chemotherapy and panitumumab induction may work
      better in treating patients with colorectal cancer.

      IV. To compare the quality of life (QOL) as measured by health state index (HIS) between
      patients who achieve partial response (PR) versus (vs.) those who progress and those who have
      stable disease during the induction phase.

      V. To compare the QOL as measured by HSI between the two groups randomized to maintenance
      therapy.

      VI. To assess the evolution of RAS mutation under treatment during induction phase as well as
      maintenance.

      VII. To explore relationship between genomic and proteomic alterations of the tumor with
      response and PFS to panitumumab.

      Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a rare autoimmune, inflammatory disorder of the orbit and
      represents the most common extra-thyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease (GD). Several
      lines of evidence suggest an important role of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in the pathogenesis
      of TED; increased levels of IL-17A have been detected in the serum and tears of patients with
      TED and IL-17A levels correlate with clinical activity of the disease. Th17 cells (as well as
      other cellular sources of IL-17A, e.g. Tc17 cells)have been shown to infiltrate the orbital
      tissue of affected patients, producing IL-17A. IL-17A stimulates fibroblast activation,
      leading to retrobulbar tissue expansion and orbital fibrosis, which causes significant
      functional impairment. Secukinumab is a recombinant high-affinity fully human monoclonal
      anti-IL-17A antibody currently approved for the treatment of 3 inflammatory/ autoimmune
      diseases: moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and axial
      spondyloarthritis (axSpA) (ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axSpA). The
      purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 300 mg s.c.

      Elevated blood cholesterol, and particularly LDL cholesterol, is a risk factor for heart
      disease. Tocotrienols are naturally-occurring compounds in foods that may have beneficial
      effects on blood cholesterol. Tocotrienols are members of the vitamin E family, and are found
      in barley, oats, rye, coconut oil and rice bran oil, but the richest source of tocotrienols
      is palm oil. Certain of these tocotrienols have been shown to be effective in lowering LDL
      (or 'bad') cholesterol, with no adverse effects on the HDL (or 'good') cholesterol. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a palm-oil derived tocotrienol
      supplement on blood cholesterol, and particularly LDL cholesterol, in individuals who are
      taking statins, and have either elevated or normal cholesterol levels. Study subjects will
      consume a palm-oil derived supplement of tocotrienol for 3 months to determine its effects on
      LDL cholesterol.
    ",Effects of a Supplement Derived From Palm Oil on Cholesterol Levels in the Blood,Hypercholesterolemia,Hypercholesterolemia,"
      Both tocotrienols and tocopherols, whose derivatives are in eight different isoforms, are
      closely related structurally. Tocopherols are generally present in common vegetable oils
      (i.e. soy, canola). However, tocotrienols are concentrated in cereal grains (ie. oat, barley,
      and rye, rice bran), with the highest level found in crude palm oil. The development of new
      cholesterol-lowering agents has been given more and more attention by pharmaceutical
      companies due to the strong relationship between cholesterol and atherosclerosis.
      Tocotrienols, especially δ- and γ-tocotrienols, were shown to be effective nutritional agents
      to treat high cholesterol in recent research programs. In particular, γ-tocotrienol appears
      to inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase at a posttranscriptional level and
      there is some evidence that tocopherols antagonize this effect. Therefore, the current study
      is designed to demonstrate that treatment with a tocotrienol-enriched fraction of palm oil
      for a three month period will lead to a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol with no
      effect on HDL cholesterol in patients whose cholesterol level is not adequately controlled in
      spite of statins. This objective will be achieved utilizing a simple three arm randomized
      placebo-controlled trial in a total of 99 subjects After acclimation to a step I AHA diet and
      no supplemental vitamin E in the diet, subjects will be given either a placebo capsule or a
      tocotrienol (120mg or 240mg) capsule in addition to their statin medications

      The main objective of this randomized trial is to compare disease-free survival (DFS) in high
      risk leukemia patients who underwent haploidentical HCT followed by an add back strategy of
      HSV-Tk donor lymphocytes or standard haploidentical HCT
    ",Efficacy Study on the Strategy of HSV-Tk Engineering Donor Lymphocytes to Treat Patients With High Risk Acute Leukemia,Acute Leukemia (Category),"['Leukemia', 'Acute Disease']","
      Delayed immune-reconstitution remains one of the main limitation of haploidentical stem cell
      transplantation. The risk of severe infections remains high for several months and CD3+
      reconstitution could take more than 10 months. The low number of lymphocytes infused with the
      graft, the degree of HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) disparity, and a reduced thymic function
      in adults and differences in host/donor antigen presenting cells are contributing causes.

      The infusions of HSV-TK engineered lymphocytes may represent a significant therapeutic
      improvement in haploidentical HCT (hematopoietic cell transplantation), because it remarkably
      may enhance both GvL (Graft versus Leukemia) activity, thus reducing the occurrence of
      disease relapse, and post-transplant immune reconstitution in the absence of chronic immune
      suppression, thus decreasing the rate of both post-transplant opportunistic infections and
      transplant-related mortality. Furthermore, the efficient control of GvHD achieved via the
      suicide mechanism allows also the multiple infusion of HSV-TK-treated donor lymphocytes, when
      needed, that might further improve post-transplant host immune reconstitution, and survival
      in patients receiving haplo-HCT. Finally, this therapeutic approach can become a valuable
      option for all candidates, including patients with advanced disease and older age.

      The proposed clinical trial represents an innovative therapeutic treatment for patients
      affected by high risk acute leukemia, who have undergone haploidentical stem cell
