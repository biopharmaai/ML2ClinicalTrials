      The main aims of this clinical study are to find out the maximum dose that can be given
      safely to patients, the potential side effects of the drug and how they can be managed and
      what happens to AZD3965 inside the body.

      AZD3965 is a type of drug called a monocarboxylate transporter 1 inhibitor which is being
      used to stop the growth of cancer cells and kill cancer cells by blocking the action of one
      of the proteins involved in moving chemical compounds in and out of the cells of the body.
      This will be the first time that this type of drug has been given to patients.

      The drug is a capsule and is taken daily. The study is in two parts. In Part 1 of the study,
      small groups of patients are treated at increasing doses to find the highest safe dose and
      best dose to give to patients in Part 2 of the study. It is planned that 40 patients will be
      entered into Part 1 of the trial.

      In Part 2, the dose found to be safe in Part 1 is given to patients with diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). It is planned that 20 patients will be entered
      into Part 2 of the trial.

      Patients will need to visit the hospital weekly for two months and then every fortnight.
      Patients will have regular blood and urine tests, scans, heart traces and eye tests amongst
      other clinical tests. Research blood samples will also be taken to look at what happens to
      the drug inside the body. Treatment is planned to be given for up to 6 months, but patients
      benefiting from treatment will be able to keep having it for as long as they continue to
      benefit. It is important to explain that this is the first study of this drug and patients
      will have advanced cancer so it is unlikely that patients will benefit directly from taking
      part but the study may help improve future treatment of cancer.

      Background:

      Mesothelioma is a type of cancer. It originates in cells that line human body cavities. Most
      people have advanced disease when they are diagnosed. Researchers want to see if a
      combination of drugs can help.

      Objective:

      To find a safe dose of LMB-100 in combination with ipilimumab when LMB-100 is injected into
      tumors.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older with malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, that cannot be
      cured with surgery and has not responded to standard first-line treatments for mesothelioma.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Tumor biopsy or effusion, if needed

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Imaging scans

        -  Heart and lung function tests

        -  Pregnancy test, if needed

      Some screening tests will be repeated during the study.

      Participants will get LMB-100 on Days 1 and 4 for up to 2 cycles. Each cycle lasts 21 days.
      They will stay in the hospital for about 8 days each time they get LMB-100. It will be
      injected into their tumor with needles.

      Participants will get ipilimumab through a tube that is put in a vein. It will be given on
      Day 2 of the first 2 cycles and Day 1 of the next 2 cycles.

      Participants will be assessed for how well they do daily activities. They will give blood and
      tissue samples for research.

      Participants will have a safety visit 4 to 6 weeks after the last dose of the study drugs.
      Then they will have scans every 6 weeks until their disease gets worse. If their tumor gets
      bigger, they will have phone, video, or email follow-ups every 12 weeks.

      Participants will be on this study for life....

      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the most common procedure performed by cardiac
      surgeons. Post-operative atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common adverse event following
      CABG, experienced in 20-50% of patients; the highest incidence of AF occurs by the third
      post-operative day. Reduction of AF by various drugs is moderately effective, but involves
      either rate control with beta blockers or rate conversion with amiodarone after the
      myocardial damage processes initiating AF have already occurred. Decreasing the incidence of
      post-operative AF, and hence the morbidity and mortality of high-risk CABG patients, could be
      more fruitfully approached by targeting the upstream combined processes of inflammation and
      coagulation activation induced by the surgical insult and associated ischemia-reperfusion
      (I/R). We propose that cell damage induced by oxidative stress and I/R injury could be
      prevented and/or inhibited by antioxidant supplementation. Specifically the investigators
      hypothesize that high-dose intravenous (IV) vitamin C supplementation will ameliorate ROS and
      therefore damp down upstream inflammatory processes, leading to a reduction of downstream
      adverse events with demonstrable links to inflammation processes, such as AF.

      In patients with moderate to severe thermal injuries (> 20% TBSA) adequate fluid
      resuscitation is the main priority to achieve successful outcomes. Soon after burn injury
      substantial amounts of fluid accumulate rapidly in the wound while more is lost in the third
      space. Without intervention this process leads to hypotension and shock. The Parkland formula
      was devised to calculate how much intravenous (IV) fluid, i.e. crystalloids, is needed for
      adequate resuscitation during the first 24 hours post-burn. However, IV resuscitation can
      lead to overexpansion of (third space) volume, leading to severe complications such as
      compartment syndrome or pulmonary edema.

      In major population centers, catastrophic events causing mass casualties will disrupt many
      hospital and emergency services, potentially delaying acute IV fluid resuscitation. Burn
      patient case reports have shown that oral rehydration therapy (ORT) used to supplement or in
      place of IV therapy is efficacious. ORT could be easily applied in mass burn casualties.

      ORT is generally known in the third world for treating life-threatening dehydration due to
      diarrhea. The glucose-sodium co transport mechanism enables the affected human intestine to
      absorb a sufficient amount of water and electrolytes to replace large fluid losses due to
      severe diarrhea, even under adverse field conditions. No electrolyte disturbances have been
      recorded in such cases. Studies on enteral resuscitation in animal burn models showed high
      rates of small intestinal absorption which should be adequate for resuscitation following
      major burn injury.

      The optimal composition of oral rehydration solution for resuscitation in burn wounds has not
      been determined. In cholera patients, Ceralyte® has proven superior to the World Health
      Organization Oral Rehydration Solution, increasing fluid absorption of the intestine. The
      Ceralyte® 90 solution, with 90mEq/L sodium and a low osmolarity of <275mOsm, may also
      contribute to optimal intestinal fluid uptake without causing electrolyte disturbances in
      thermal injury. ORT use might reduce the occurrence of compartment syndrome and pulmonary
      edema since fluid is regulated by the intestine according to physiologic requirements. The
      investigators propose to conduct a prospective study using Ceralyte® 90 to show that oral
      resuscitation therapy (ORT) in burns can reduce the total amount of IV fluid needed for
      adequate resuscitation and to test the efficacy and safety of ORT in the resuscitation of
      burn patients.

      Malignant gliomas have a very poor prognosis with median survival measured in months rather
      than years. It is a disease in great need of novel therapeutic approaches. Based on the
      encouraging results of our preclinical studies which demonstrate improved efficacy without
      added toxicity, the paradigm of delivering a novel oncolytic adenovirus via a neural stem
      cell line in combination with radiation and chemotherapy is well-suited for evaluation in
      newly diagnosed malignant gliomas. The standard-of-care allows application of virotherapy as

      Background:

      Enzalutamide is given to treat metastatic prostate cancer. But it takes 4 pills to deliver
      the effective dose. This can be difficult for people already taking multiple drugs. And
      swallowing may be difficult for some people. Researchers want to test out a new way of giving
      enzalutamide by mouth. They want to see if giving a person the liquid taken from inside the
      standard 4 gelatin capsules is handled by the body in the same way as giving them the
      capsules whole.

      Objectives:

      To compare how capsule and liquid forms of enzalutamide are handled by people with prostate
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Men at least 18 years old with prostate cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a heart test (electrocardiogram), medical history, and
      physical exam. A tissue sample or lab reports will be reviewed.

      During the study, participants will repeat screening tests and have urine tests.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to get the study drug in one of two orders: either the
      as capsules then the liquid form (Arm A) or as the liquid form then the capsule form (Arm B).

      Participants will be counseled about birth control.

      The study will have 2 periods with a minimum 42 day break in between.

      On Day 1 of Period 1 and Day 1 of Period 2, participants will be admitted to the hospital.
      They will get one dose of the study drug. They cannot eat or drink anything except water for
      at least 10 hours before and for 4 hours after the study drug. Their blood will be sampled
      over 24 hours. Lunch and dinner will be served. Participants will answer questions after
      taking the liquid form.

      Participants will have blood drawn on Day 3, Day 8, and Day 42.

      This exploratory study aims to assess exposure of healthy subjects to systemic challenge with
      either LPS or GM-CSF. This will be done by measuring inflammatory mediators and cellular
      activation markers both in circulation and in skin blisters induced by exposure to
      cantharidin (an agent that causes blisters). LPS is often used to induce inflammation whereas
      GM-CSF is a cytokine and a key mediator in inflammatory diseases. In this 2 parts study,
      subjects will have 2 sessions in each part. Part I of the study is a dose-exploration phase
      and part II will be a continuation phase to draw more precise outcomes. In session 1,
      subjects will be randomized to receive either LPS or GM-CSF and will have 2 blisters induced
      on each forearm followed by blood draws and a blister harvest on each forearm at 24 and 48
      hours post-induction. After a minimum of 14 days blister healing period, subjects will return
      for session 2. In part I, Up to 6 cohorts will be tested and all cohorts will have 2
      sessions. For Part I, initially Cohort 1 will proceed with session 1. After their blister
      healing period, Cohort 1 will return for their session 2 visit in two groups (Group A and
      Group B) on different days. Group A will be dosed on the same day (one with LPS and one with
      GM-CSF) and Group B will be dosed on a different day (one with LPS and one with GM-CSF) after
      group A. Dose-escalation in Cohort 2-6 will be continued until the well tolerated dose has
      been determined. The same dose will be administered to an additional Cohort in Part II and
      the same 2-session design will be used. Approximately 24-30 healthy subjects will be enrolled
      for the study and the total duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 13

      Background:

        -  Bone marrow stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow and blood stream, can be
           collected and transplanted to treat a variety of types of cancer in a process known as
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). When stem cells are taken from one
           person, most commonly a sibling or a family member, and then given to another person,
           this is referred to as allogeneic HSCT. Allogeneic HSCT has proven to be an especially
           effective treatment for patients with some types of cancers of the blood (leukemia) and
           certain solid tumors. The transplanted stem cells travel to the patient's bone marrow
           and begin producing normal blood cells, and also attack patients cancer cells.

        -  Because allogenic HSCT does not always prevent the cancer from returning, researchers
           are interested in determining whether another type of immune cell taken from the stem
           cell donors white blood cells, called a ""natural killer"" (NK) cell, can be given in
           addition to the HSCT to help fight the tumor. In the laboratory, NK cells have been
           shown to kill tumor cells, but it is not yet know if this will occur when given to
           patients after HSCT.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety, effectiveness, and immune system response of giving NK white
           blood cells to individuals who have received allogeneic HSCT.

        -  To identify possible side effects from the treatment.

      Eligibility:

        -  Donors: Stem cell donors whose blood matches one of the recipients on six out of six
           human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (blood immune marker) types. The donor may not be the
           identical twin of a recipient.

        -  Recipients: Individuals between 4 and 35 years of age who have been diagnosed with
           pediatric solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment, or individuals
           between 4 and 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with leukemia that has not
           responded to standard treatment.

        -  Other eligibility requirements which include a physical exam and blood laboratory
           evaluation are included to make sure it is safe for both the donor to donate and the
           recipient to undergo the transplant procedure.

      Design:

        -  Donors and recipients will be screened with a full medical history and physical
           examination, and will provide blood and urine samples; recipients will have tumor
           imaging studies and other tests as required by the researchers.

        -  Donors:

        -  Participants will receive filgrastim injections (to stimulate the bone marrow) for 1
           week to make stem cells travel from bone marrow to blood.

        -  Participants will provide stem cells and NK cells through apheresis.

        -  Recipients:

        -  Participants will have three cycles of chemotherapy to treat the underlying cancer and
           weaken the immune system so that it will accept the donor cells.

        -  Participants will then receive preparative chemotherapy for the transplant and two days
           after the last dose of chemotherapy, participants will have allogenic HSCT using the
           donated stem cells.

        -  Participants will receive an infusion of NK cells on days 7 and 35 after the HSCT. -
           Participants will remain in the hospital for monitoring after the HSCT and NK cell
           treatments, and will be followed closely as outpatients for the first 6 months after the
           transplant and then less frequently for at least 5 years.

      This longitudinal, prospective study aims to establish the magnitude and time course of
      changes in intestinal permeability; establish the optimal method for assessment of intestinal
      permeability in thermally injured participants: describe the participant population most
      likely to benefit from a new medicinal product which could prevent changes in intestinal
      permeability; and improve our understanding of the links between intestinal damage, changes
      in the gut microbiome and microbial translocation to the systemic circulation following
      thermal injury. The key factors of interest in this study are to understand the impact of
      thermal injury on intestinal permeability in thermally injured participants compared to
      healthy participants; and to understand the changes in intestinal permeability over time.
      Approximately 15 eligible healthy participants and 25 thermally injury participants will be
      included. The sugar test material (STM) comprises of Lactulose, Mannitol and Sucralose and
      will be intermittently administered enterally to all the participants. The full duration of
      the study for healthy participants will be approximately two weeks and 6 months for thermally
      injured participants. In order to enter this study thermally injured participants will be
      required to co-enroll in this study and an allied study entitled: A Multi-center, Prospective
      Study to Examine the Relationship between Neutrophil Function and Sepsis in Adults and
      Children with Severe Thermal Injury (SIFTI-2). (reference number IRAS ID: 200366).

      Young adults who exhibit ""bipolar phenotype"" (BPP), defined as occasional episodes of mood
      elevation and heightened activity, are at risk for several psychiatric disorders, including
      problem use of drugs and alcohol. Mood elevation has been linked to higher alcohol
      consumption and alcohol use disorders. Individuals with BPP show elevated lifetime prevalence
      of alcohol use disorders (between 39%-61%), figures that exceed those reported in both major
      depression and schizophrenia. Recently, the investigators demonstrated in a controlled
      laboratory study that individuals with BPP (but not meeting criteria for full Bipolar I
      Disorder), report dampened responses to a single dose of alcohol, compared to placebo. In the
      current study, the investigators seek to extend these findings to determine if young adults
      reporting BPP, based on a questionnaire, will exhibit reduced responses to other rewarding
      stimuli, such as d-amphetamine and sweet tastes. The investigators hypothesize that the BPP
      individuals will exhibit dampened subjective responses to stimulant and sweet taste rewards
      compared to healthy controls.

      Background:

      LMB-100 is a man-made protein. It is attracted to the mesothelin protein. This is found in
      many tumors, including mesothelioma. But it is found in only a very small number of normal
      tissues. After binding to mesothelin on tumors, LMB-100 attacks and kills cancer cells.
      Researchers want to test LMB-100 in people with advanced mesothelioma.

      Objective:

      To find a safe dose and anti-tumor activity of LMB-100 for people with advanced mesothelioma.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older with:

      Advanced pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma that has not responded to platinum-based

      therapy

      Adequate organ function

      Design:

      Chest x-rays

      Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans

      Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans

      Participants will get LMB-100 on days 1, 3, and 5 of each 21-day cycle. It will be given
      through an intravenous (IV) catheter, a tube inserted in an arm vein. They will get standard
      medicines before each infusion to help prevent side effects. Each infusion lasts about 30
      minutes. They will be monitored for up to 2 hours after.

      During each cycle, participants will repeat the screening tests.

      Participants will get the study drug for up to 4 cycles or until their disease worsens or
      they have intolerable side effects.

      About 4-6 weeks after their last infusion, participants will have a follow-up visit. They
      will repeat the study tests.

      Participants will have follow-up scans every 6 weeks until their disease gets worse.

      Participants will be called about once a year to see how they are doing.

      This study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and the
      therapeutic potential of GSK2857916 in subjects with multiple myeloma (MM) and lymphomas that
      express B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). The hypothesis is that GSK2857916 can be safely
      administered to subjects with MM and with BCMA positive malignancies at doses where target
      engagement can be demonstrated. This study will determine if adequate target engagement of
      BCMA receptors translates into clinical benefit for subjects with MM and BCMA positive
      lymphomas. The study will consists of two parts: a Part 1 dose escalation phase and a Part 2
      expansion phase for safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and clinical activity testing. The study
      will enroll a total of approximately 80-95 subjects with relapsed/refractory MM or
      BCMA-expressing hematologic malignancies. The maximum dose to be administered in this trial
      will not exceed 5 milligram/kilogram(mg/kg).

      Second phase: Durvalumab every 4 weeks and Vicineum once every other week

      Participants will have tumor samples taken every 3 months. They will have blood and urine
      tests throughout the study.

      Participants will continue treatment for up to 2 years.

      Participants will have a visit about 30 days after their last treatment. This includes blood
      and urine tests. It may include a cytoscopy or additional biopsies.

      Unfortunately, hospital-acquired weakness is highly prevalent among COVID-19 hospitalized
      patients, who often require prolonged bed-rest or paralytics for an extended period of time
      in order to maintain oxygenation. Prolonged bed rest has been associated with pronounced loss
      of muscle mass that can exceed 10% over the 1st week, which leads to functional impairment
      and complications post-hospital discharge. Physical therapy and in-hospital mobility program
      may reduce the incident of hospital-acquired weakness, but they are often impractical for
      COVID-19 patients. In particular, conventional mobility programs are challenging for those
      who are being treated in an intensive Care Unit. The purpose of this study is to test
      feasibility and proof-of-concept effectiveness of daily use of lower extremity electrical
      stimulation (EE) therapy, as a practical solution to address lower extremity muscle
      deconditioning, to address chronic consequences of COVID-19 including hospital-acquired

      This study is in 2 parts. Different participants will take part in the 1st and 2nd parts of
      the study.

      The main aim of the 1st part of the study is to check how much Mobocertinib adults with
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can receive without getting side effects from it.

      The main aim of the 2nd part of the study is to learn if the condition of adults with
      non-small cell lung cancer improves after treatment with Mobocertinib. Another aim is to
      continue checking for side effects from Mobocertinib.

      In the 1st part of the study, at the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take
      part. For those that can take part, participants will take a capsule of Mobocertinib once a
      day for 28 days. This will count as 1 cycle. Different small groups of participants will
      receive lower to higher doses of Mobocertinib. The study doctors will check for side effects
      after each dose of TAK 788. In this way, researchers can work out the best dose of
      Mobocertinib to give participants in the 2nd part of the study.

      Participants will visit the clinic 30 days after their treatment has finished for a final
      check-up.

      In the 2nd part of the study, at the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take
      part. Participants will receive the best dose of Mobocertinib worked out from the 1st part of
      the study. Participants will receive Mobocertinib in the same way as those from the 1st part
      of the study. The study doctors will learn if the condition of these participants improves
      after treatment with Mobocertinib. The study doctors will also check for side effects from
      Mobocertinib.

      After treatment has finished, participants will visit the clinic every 12 weeks until the end
      of the study.

      In both parts of the study, participants can receive Mobocertinib for up to just over 1 year,
      or longer if their condition stays improved.

      Background:

      - Pazopanib is an anticancer drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels in tumors. It
      has been approved to treat renal cell cancer and soft tissue sarcomas in patients who have
      received prior chemotherapy. ARQ 197 (Tivantinib) is an experimental drug that blocks a
      protein called mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET), which cancer cells need to
      grow. Studies suggest that some drugs that block blood vessel growth can increase the
      production of c-MET in tumors, which helps cancer cells keep growing. Blocking both blood
      vessel growth and c-MET with pazopanib and ARQ 197 may help kill cancer cells faster. This
      study will use these drugs to treat solid tumors that have not responded to earlier
      treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of pazopanib and ARQ 197 for advanced solid tumors.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded
      to earlier treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have blood and urine tests, and imaging studies.

        -  The study drugs will be given in 4-week cycles of treatment. Participants will take
           pazopanib once a day and ARQ 197 twice a day by mouth. Some participants will start with
           pazopanib or ARQ 197 alone for the first week. Then they will take both drugs together
           for the rest of the study.

        -  Participants will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Optional
           tumor samples may be collected during different treatment cycles.

                  the fat challenge during the screening visit, which consists of heavy cream and
                  lactase enzyme. Many people with lactose intolerance successfully avert symptoms
                  by correcting their lactase deficiency with lactase supplements. We will allow
                  these people to participate because we will allow them to take their preferred
                  brand and dose of lactase supplement beyond the lactase in the fat challenge if
                  needed. However, we still require that they are able to tolerate the test dose

                  first experimental visit until at least 6 weeks after the final dose given during
                  the previous investigational drug study. For the purposes of this exclusion, an
                  investigational drug is a new chemical entity or a pharmaceutical investigated to

      Ranitidine is an over-the-counter and prescription drug, which decreases the amount of acid
      secreted by the stomach. Some ranitidine medicines contain an impurity called
      N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at low levels. NDMA is classified as a probable human
      carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory tests. NDMA
      is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and foods, including meats, dairy
      products, and vegetables.

      The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has found levels of NDMA in some ranitidine
      products similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like
      grilled or smoked meats. The ranitidine that will be used in this study has been tested twice
      (months apart) and shown to have stable NDMA levels well below the acceptable daily limit. Of
      note, the risk of NDMA with ranitidine is only relevant with prolonged chronic administration
      as at the acceptable limit, there is approximately a 1 in 100,000 chance of cancer after 70
      years of exposure to that level.

      FDA has also conducted tests that simulate the potential formation of NDMA from ranitidine
      after it has been exposed to acid in the stomach with a normal diet. Results of these tests
      indicate that NDMA is not formed in typical stomach conditions. Similarly, if ranitidine is
      exposed to a simulated small intestinal fluid, NDMA is not formed. Other laboratory
      experiments suggest a combination of nitrites, such as found in processed meats, and an
      acidic environment may increase NDMA formation, however the levels of nitrites tested were
      very high. Separately, a previous study in 10 healthy volunteers showed that volunteers who
      received ranitidine had an increase in urinary NDMA excreted over 24 h. The level of increase
      was greater than would be expected from laboratory testing.

      This clinical study is being performed to determine if and how much NDMA is produced from
      ranitidine in the human body and whether nitrite-containing foods may increase formation of
      NDMA. The study will use a prescription dose of ranitidine (300 mg) to test whether there is
      increased urinary NDMA excretion levels over 24-hours after ranitidine administration in
      comparison to placebo when participants are administered low nitrite/NDMA meals and when
      subjects are administered high nitrite/NDMA meals. On 4 different days, each participant will
      receive ranitidine or placebo with high nitrite/NDMA meals and ranitidine or placebo with low
      nitrite/NDMA meals.

      Previous clinical studies of immediate release (IR) formulations of GSK2982772 resulted in a
      high peak to trough ratio of GSK2982772. Additionally, the short half-life for GSK2982772
      (approximately 2 to 3 hours) necessitates twice a daily (BID) or thrice daily (TID) dosing of
      an IR formulation. As a result, MR formulations using a polymer matrix approach with
      minitablets in capsule and MR tablet formulations were investigated. The emerging PK data of
      the MR formulations investigated to date have demonstrated that a once daily (QD) PK profile
      can be achieved in the fasted state but the polymer matrix formulation is susceptible to food
      effects when administered with a high fat breakfast. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      MR prototype coated tablet formulations. This study will evaluate the PK of MR prototype
      coated tablet formulations of GSK2982772. The study is divided into two parts; Part A and
      Part B. The MR tablet coating used in Part A and the initial periods of Part B will have an
      aperture drilled into the enteric coating of either side of the tablet. This allows some drug
      release to commence in the stomach whilst providing controlled release throughout the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In Part B only, a new investigational medicinal product (IMP)
      will be manufactured to allow comparison of the tablet coating either with apertures (i.e.,
      drilled) or without apertures (i.e., full coat/non drilled). Part A will be a 6-period, 6-way
      fixed sequence design, up to 4 MR tablet prototype coated formulations will be evaluated in
      fasted state at 240 milligrams (mg). Periods 1, 2 and 3 will evaluate MR1, IR tablet and MR2
      respectively. Periods 4, 5 and 6 will be flexible and the dosing regimen will be dependent on
      the outcome of Periods 1 to 3. In addition, the impact of food (high fat meal, standard
      breakfast or administration 30 or 60 minutes before a standard breakfast) on selected MR
      prototype coated tablet formulations may also be evaluated in Period 4, 5 or 6 of Part A.
      Each inpatient period for MR regimens (Periods 1, 3, 4 to 6) will consist of 4 days and 3
      nights, and the inpatient period for the IR tablet (Period 2) will consist of 3 days and 2
      nights. There will be a minimum washout of 7 days between doses, and a follow-up visit will
      occur at 7 to 9 days after the last study treatment. The Part B of the study will be a
      7-period fixed sequence which will evaluate the selected MR prototype coated tablet
      formulation(s) at different tablet strengths or as multiple unit doses and with or without
      apertures in the tablet coatings. There will be an interim review after each period 1 to 5 of
      Part B to select the dose level, formulation and prandial status for each subsequent period.
      An interim data review after Part B Period 6 will determine if optional Period 7 is required
      and the dose level, dosing time (morning or evening), formulation and prandial status for
      that period. Each inpatient period will consist of a 4-day and 3-night with a minimum of 7
      days washout between doses. A follow-up visit will occur at 7 to 9 days after the last study
      treatment. Approximately 33 subjects will be enrolled in the study. The total duration for
      Part A will be approximately 10-12 weeks and 10-14 weeks for Part B (including screening
      period of approximately 4 weeks).

      Background:

      -Cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19) and cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) are often
      found on certain cancer cells. Researchers think that a person's T cells can be modified in a
      lab to kill cells that have CD19 and CD20 on the surface.

      Objective:

      -To see if it is safe to give anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 CAR T cells to people with a B cell
      cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Eligibility:

      -People ages 18 and older with a B cell cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma that has not been
      controlled with standard therapies

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened under protocol 01C0129 with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and heart tests

        -  Bone marrow biopsy: A needle is inserted into the participant's hip bone to remove a
           small amount of marrow.

      Scans

        -  Participants will have apheresis: Blood will be removed through a vein. The blood with
           circulate through a machine that removes the T cells. The rest of the blood will be
           returned to the participant.

        -  Once a day for 3 days before they get the T cells, participants will receive
           chemotherapy through a vein.

        -  Participants will receive the T cells through a vein. They will stay in the hospital for
           at least 9 days.

        -  Participants may have a lumbar puncture: A needle will remove fluid from the spinal
           cord.

        -  Participants may have a tumor biopsy.

        -  Participants will repeat the screening tests throughout the study.

        -  Participants will have follow-up visits 2 weeks after infusion; monthly for 4 months; at
           6, 9, and 12 months; every 6 months for 3 years; and then annually for 5 years.
           Participants will then be contacted annually for 15 years.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        MALIGNANCY CRITERIA:

        Note: As of approval of Amendment A, no patients with Hodgkin lymphoma can be enrolled
        until at least 6 patients with B-cell malignancies are treated without incidence of
        Guillain-Bare syndrome

          -  Patients must have any B-cell lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small
             lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), Gray-zone lymphoma, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin
             lymphoma, or classical Hodgkin lymphoma with any cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19)
             or cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) expression on Reed-Sternberg cells. Lower
             grade lymphomas or CLL transformed to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are
             potentially eligible as is primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and all other subtypes
             of DLBCL. Burkitt and mantle cell lymphoma are potentially eligible.

          -  For classical Hodgkin lymphoma only, a biopsy from any time from any institution that
             shows any CD19 or CD20 expression on Reed-Sternberg cells is adequate for eligibility.
             CD19 or CD20 expression on the Reed-Sternberg cells that is weak or only present on
             some Reed-Sternberg cells by immunohistochemistry is compatible with protocol
             eligibility.

          -  For all lymphoma types except for classical Hodgkin lymphoma, either CD19 or CD20
             expression must be uniform. Uniform CD19 or CD20 expression is defined as no obvious
             lymphoma population lacking antigen expression is present. Antigen expression can be
             assessed by either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry.

          -  Only when insufficient biopsy material is available to allow CD19 and CD20 expression
             assessment at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), CD19 and/or CD20 staining
             performed at another institution can be used

          -  DLBCL patients must have received at least two prior chemotherapy-containing regimens
             at least one of which must have contained doxorubicin and a monoclonal antibody.
             Follicular lymphoma patients must have received at least 2 prior regimens including at
             least 1 regimen with chemotherapy. All other B-cell lymphoma and leukemia patients
             must have had at least 1 prior chemotherapy-containing regimen. All patients with CLL
             or small lymphocytic lymphoma must have had prior treatment with ibrutinib or another
             signal transduction inhibitor and venetoclax.

          -  Hodgkin lymphoma patients must have:

               -  had at least 3 prior lines of therapy.

               -  had at least 1 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy-containing regimen.

               -  had prior exposure to brentuximab vedotin.

               -  had undergone autologous stem cell transplant or been transplant ineligible or
                  refused autologous transplantation

          -  Eligibility will be expanded to include CD19 and CD20-negative classical Hodgkin
             lymphoma if any 2 patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma and CD19/CD20 expression on
             Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells have durations of response 6 months or greater (responses
             could be partial responses (PRs) or complete responses (CRs) or a CR of 3 months or
             greater.

          -  All patients must have measurable malignancy as defined by at least one of the
             criteria below.

          -  Lymphoma or leukemia masses that are measurable (minimum 1.5 cm in largest diameter)
             by computed tomography (CT) scan is required for all diagnoses except CLL. All masses
             must be less than or equal to 10.0 cm in the largest diameter.

          -  For a lymphoma mass to count as measurable malignancy, it must have abnormally
             increased metabolic activity when assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) scan.
             CLL masses do not need to have increased activity on positron emission tomography
             (PET) scan.

          -  For CLL and lymphoma with only bone marrow involvement no mass is necessary, but if a
             mass is not present, bone marrow malignancy must be detectable by flow cytometry in
             lymphoma and CLL. Note that leukemia cells must make up 1% or less of peripheral blood
             lymphocytes in CLL patients for these patients to be eligible.

             hepatitis B core antibody can be enrolled.

          -  Patients must be tested for the presence of Hepatitis C antigen by PCR and be
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) negative in order to be eligible. Only

          -  Patients must not take corticosteroids including prednisone, dexamethasone or any
             other corticosteroid for 14 days before apheresis and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR)
             T-cell infusion. Patients must also not take corticosteroids at doses higher than 5
             mg/day of prednisone or equivalent at any time after the CAR T cell infusion.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Patients who have either been previously treated on protocols of genetically-modified
             T cells on a clinical trial at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) or received T cells
             modified with the murine stem cell virus-based splice-gag (MSGV) or murine stem cell
             virus-based splice-gag 1 (MSGV1) gamma-retroviral vectors at any institution are
             potentially eligible under these conditions:

               -  At least 3 months have elapsed since the last genetically-modified T-cell therapy
                  that the patient received, and there is no evidence of replication-competent
                  retroviruses (evidence must be provided from prior protocol Principal
                  Investigator), and persisting genetically-modified T cells are either not
                  detectable in the patient's blood or detectable at levels less than or equal to
                  0.2% of blood T cells as measured by flow cytometry using the Kip-1 antibody in
                  the flow cytometry lab of the NCI Laboratory of Pathology (Maryalice

          -  Patients that have active hemolytic anemia.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients are excluded because HIV causes
             complicated immune deficiency and study treatment can pose more risks for these
             patients.

          -  Patients with second malignancies in addition to their B-cell malignancy are not
             eligible if the second malignancy has required treatment (including maintenance
             therapy) within the past 3 years or is not in complete remission. There are two
             exceptions to this criterion: successfully treated non-metastatic basal cell or
             squamous cell skin carcinoma.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the preparative chemotherapy on the fetus or infant.

        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because study therapy can cause fetal harm.
        Because there is potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
        treatment of the mother with study therapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
        mother is treated with study drugs.

             immunosuppressed post organ transplant. However, patients receiving inhaled
             corticosteroids and patients with a history of allergy (other than anaphylaxis) are
             eligible, as are patients with a history of auto-immune disease.

      Adults at least 18 years old with ALS and high levels of HERV-K but no HIV.

      Design:

      Interested participants can contact the study team and, if eligible, the study team will
      arrange for a screening blood draw to determine the HERV-K level.

      Participants with a high HERV-K level will be screened with medical history, physical exam,
      questionnaires, nerve conduction test, lumbar puncture, and blood and breathing tests.

      After screening, participants will start taking the 4 study drugs.

      Participants will have up to 12 study visits over a period of 72 weeks. After starting study
      drugs, they will have study visits at Weeks 1 and 4 and then every 4 weeks until Week 28.
      They will be asked how they are feeling and have an exam and blood drawn. At 3 visits, they
      will have tests of nerve conduction, breathing, and their ALS symptoms.

      At Week 24, they will stop taking the study drugs and may have a repeat lumbar puncture.

      After the Week 48 visit, their participation is finished.

      Background:

      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is treated with antiretroviral drugs. Many people with HIV
      also have the lung infection tuberculosis (TB). Most TB treatments are complicated. A simpler
      treatment of two TB drugs can be taken once a week. Researchers want to study how the HIV and
      TB drugs affect each other so people who take both can be treated safely.

      Objective:

      To study if rifapentine and isoniazid affect blood levels of the common antiretroviral TAF.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18-65 without HIV, TB, or hepatitis

      Design:

      Participants will fast before the screening visit. They will have a medical history, physical
      exam, and blood tests. Women may have a pregnancy test.

      During the study, participants must:

      Use effective birth control

      Not take most medicine

      Not drink alcohol

      At the baseline visit, participants will repeat screening tests and get TAF tablets.

      Participants will take TAF once a day for 31 days. They will keep track of doses and side
      effects.

      Over 32 days, participants will have 4 long visits and 4 short.

      At all visits, participants will:

      Fast the night before

      Get food

      Take that day s TAF

      Review their TAF supply

      Have pregnancy and blood tests

      Report side effects

      At 3 visits, participants will also take the 2 TB drugs and vitamin B6.

      At 3 long visits, participants will also have blood collected 8 times over 8 hours by plastic
      tube in an arm vein.

      Around Day 46, participants will fast and have blood and pregnancy tests. Two weeks later,
      they will get a call to see how they are feeling....

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme,
             anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma.

          -  Prior therapy: Patients must have failed external beam radiotherapy to the brain, and
             if eligible and tolerated, undergone appropriate treatment with temozolomide
             chemotherapy. All radiation and additional chemotherapies must have been completed at
             least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Prior therapy with nitrosoureas must have been
             completed at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Age ≥18 years (age of majority for clinical trials in Alabama). Because no dosing or
             adverse event data are currently available on the use of M032 in patients <18 years of
             age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric
             phase 1 single-agent trials.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70%

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 4 weeks.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes: >3,000/μl

               -  absolute neutrophil count: >1,500/μl

               -  platelets: >100,000/μl

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)(aspartate aminotransferase)/ALT(SGPT)(alanine aminotransferase): <2.5 X

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  creatinine clearance: >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal.

          -  Residual lesion must be ≥1.0 cm and < 5.5 cm in diameter without bilateral extension
             through the corpus callosum as determined by MRI as this is a locally delivered
             treatment. These parameters will be re-evaluated on imaging done on the day of
             catheter implantation and if the lesion no longer meets.

          -  The effects of M032 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to
             study entry and for the first six months after receiving M032. Because it is currently
             unknown if M032 can be transmitted by sexual contact, a barrier method of birth
             control must be employed and for six (6) months following the administration of the
             study drug. Should a woman become pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. For two weeks after receiving M032,
             subjects should avoid intimate contact with pregnant women, infants and young children
             and individuals with decreased immunity (ability to fight infection). Subjects should
             also refrain from donating blood during the trial

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must not be pregnant; this will be confirmed by a
             negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to starting study treatment.

          -  Steroid use is allowed as long as dose has not increased within 2 weeks of scheduled
             M032 administration. Whenever possible, the patient should be on a steroid dose that
             is equivalent to a dexamethasone dose of ≤ 2mg daily at the time of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy within 4 weeks
             prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas), surgical resection within 4
             weeks prior to entering the study, or have received experimental viral therapy or gene
             therapy at any time (e.g., adenovirus, retrovirus or herpes virus protocol). However,
             this does not preclude re-treatment with M032 at a later date.

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to therapeutic interventions
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar biologic composition
             to M032 or to IL-12.

          -  Tumor involvement which would require ventricular, brainstem, basal ganglia, or
             posterior fossa inoculation or would require access through a ventricle in order to
             deliver treatment. Also, since M032 is a local treatment, patients whose tumors have
             bilateral extension through the corpus callosum, those with actively growing
             multifocal disease by MRI, and/or CSF dissemination/ leptomeningeal disease, are
             ineligible.

          -  Prior history of encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or other CNS infection.

          -  Required steroid increase within 2 weeks of scheduled M032 administration. When
             possible, the patient should be on a dexamethasone equivalent dose of ≤ 2mg daily at
             the time of treatment.

          -  Active oral herpes lesion.

          -  Concurrent therapy with any drug active against HSV (acyclovir, valacyclovir,
             penciclovir, famciclovir, gancyclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or any other medical condition that precludes surgery. Also, psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Excluded patient groups

               -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M032 is a viral oncolytic
                  therapy with unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because
                  there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
                  secondary to treatment of the mother with M032, breastfeeding women will not be
                  included in the study.

               -  Because patients with immune deficiency will be unable to mount the anticipated
                  immune response underlying this therapeutic rationale, HIV-seropositive patients
                  are excluded from this study. Other treatment studies for this disease that are
                  less dependent on the patients' immune response are more appropriate for
                  HIV-seropositive patients.

          -  Patients with known history of allergic reaction to IV contrast material that is not
             amenable to pre-treatment by University of Alabama at Birmingham protocol.

          -  Patients with pacemakers, ferro-magnetic aneurysm clips, metal infusion pumps, metal
             or shrapnel fragments or certain types of stents.

          -  Receipt of Gliadel Therapy.

          -  (Receipt of Bevacizumab (Avastin) therapy within 4 weeks of scheduled M032
             administration. (Receipt of Bevacizumab (Avastin) greater than 4 weeks of scheduled
             M032 administration does not exclude patient.)

          -  Any other reason the investigator deems subject is unfit for participation in the
             study.

      Background:

      ETBX-011, ETBX-061, and ETBX-051 are cancer vaccines. Their goal is to teach the immune
      system to target and kill cancer cells. The vaccines target 3 proteins found in many types of
      cancer. Researchers think targeting all 3 proteins in unison will have the best results.

      Objective:

      To test the safety of combining ETBX-011, ETBX-061, and ETBX-051 and their effects on the
      immune system.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with advanced cancer that has not responded to standard therapies

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Scan: They will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

      Participants will receive the 3 vaccines through 3 shots under the skin every 3 weeks for 3
      doses, then every 8 weeks for up to 1 year. They will have blood and urine tests at each
      vaccine visit. They will have scans and other measurements of their tumor after 9 weeks and
      then at their vaccine visits every 8 weeks.

      Participants will keep a diary of symptoms at the injection site.

      Participants will have a visit 90 days after their final treatment. This will include a
      physical exam and blood and urine tests. If they have any ongoing side effects, they will be
      followed until these end or are not changing.

      After this visit, they will be called every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for
      the next 2 years, then every 12 months for another 2 years to see how they are doing.

      Participants will have the option to enroll in a long-term follow-up study.

      Higher coronary in-stent thromboses and bleeding complications on anti-platelet agents are
      more common in Chronic Kidney Disease vs. non-Chronic Kidney Disease patients. Poor
      inhibition of platelet aggregation by anti-platelet agents predicts future cardiovascular
      events. Clinical practice guidelines are ambiguous about the use of these agents in Chronic
      Kidney Disease due to lack of controlled studies. The investigators hypothesize that patients
      with Chronic Kidney Disease compared with non-Chronic Kidney Disease have reduced platelet
      aggregation and poor platelet inhibitory response to aspirin. The aims are to 1) define the
      range of whole blood platelet aggregation in stages 3-5 Chronic Kidney Disease patients; 2)
      investigate whether patients with stages 4-5 Chronic Kidney Disease vs. non-Chronic Kidney
      Disease have lower platelet aggregation or impaired von Willebrand Factor activity; and 3)
      compare inhibition of platelet aggregation from baseline after 2 weeks of aspirin therapy and
      another 2 weeks of clopidogrel therapy added to aspirin in Chronic Kidney Disease vs.
      non-Chronic Kidney Disease patients. Accomplishing these aims will provide pilot data to

      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in three parts. A single ascending
      dose (SAD) study in six cohorts receiving a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of 1, 10, 30, 60,
      100, or 200 mg of rezafungin; a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in four cohorts receiving
      30 mg x 3 doses, 60 mg x 3 doses, 100 mg x 3 doses, or 200 mg x 3 doses of rezafungin SC with
      dosing frequency of once every 7 days; and a two-period cross-over bioavailability (BA) study
      receiving 100 mg of rezafungin. The two period cross-over BA study will be assessed unblinded
      in two sequences (10 subjects, 100 mg or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of rezafungin in Part
      1); 5 subjects will receive an SC injection of rezafungin in Period 1 followed by an
      intravenous (IV) infusion of rezafungin in Period 2, and 5 subjects will receive an IV
      infusion of rezafungin in Period 1 followed by an SC injection of rezafungin in Period 2.
      Each SAD (except cohort 1) and MAD cohort will contain 8 subjects (6 subjects will receive a
      SC injection of rezafungin and 2 subjects will receive placebo). Each SAD (except cohort 1)
      and MAD cohort will be conducted with sentinel dosing. SAD cohort 1 will be comprised of 4
      subjects (3:1 rezafungin to placebo) with no sentinel dosing. Parts 2 and 3 of the study will
      only be conducted after FDA review for safety data and PK data from all subjects
      participating in Part 1; Part 3 may be run in parallel with the first cohort (Cohort 7) of
      Part 2. Individuals in the SAD cohorts will participate for approximately 58 days, including
      up to 28 days for screening and 30 days for dosing and follow-up (FU). Individuals in the MAD
      cohorts will participate for approximately 73 days, including up to 28 days for screening and
      45 days for dosing and FU. Individuals in the BA cohorts will participate for approximately
      80 days, including up to 28 days for screening and 52 days for dosing and FU. The study will
      have a duration of approximately 30 months. The primary objectives are to determine the: 1)
      safety and tolerability of single ascending SC doses (SAD) of rezafungin; 2) safety and
      tolerability of multiple ascending SC doses (MAD) of rezafungin; and 3) pharmacokinetic (PK)

               1. Female participants of childbearing potential must use one form of highly
                  effective contraception. Hormonal methods must be in place from at least 2 weeks
                  prior to the first study visit. The contraception use must continue until 30 days
                  after the date of viral challenge/last dosing with IMP (whichever occurs last).
                  Highly effective contraception is as described below:

               1. Established use of hormonal methods of contraception described below (for a
                  minimum of 2 weeks prior to the first study visit). When hormonal methods of
                  contraception are used, male partners are required to use a condom with a
                  spermicide:

        the vasectomised male is the sole partner for that woman.

        f. True abstinence - sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if
        defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk
        associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be
        evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual
        lifestyle of the participant.

        b) Male participants must agree to the contraceptive requirements below at entry to
        quarantine and continuing until 90 days after the date of Viral challenge / last dosing
        with the investigational medicinal product (IMP) (whichever occurs last):

          1. Use a condom with a spermicide to prevent pregnancy in a female partner or to prevent
             exposure of any partner (male and female) to the IMP.

          2. Male sterilisation with the appropriate post vasectomy documentation of the absence of
             sperm in the ejaculate (please note that the use of condom with spermicide will still
             be required to prevent partner exposure). This applies only to males participating in
             the study

          3. In addition, for female partners of childbearing potential, that partner must use
             another form of contraception such as one of the highly effective methods mentioned
             above for female participants.

          4. True abstinence - sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if
             defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk
             associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be
             evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and
             usual lifestyle of the participant.

        c) In addition to the contraceptive requirements above, male participants must agree not to
        donate sperm following discharge from quarantine until 90 days after the date of Viral
        Challenge/last dosing with IMP (whichever occurs last).

      Background:

      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a serious disease with no cure. Some people
      with HIV have depression and other mood problems. They can have problems with thinking and
      memory. Researchers think 2 chemicals in the brain may cause those problems. The chemicals
      are serotonin and dopamine. The researchers want to take images to learn more about those
      chemicals in HIV patients.

      Objective:

      To learn how HIV affects serotonin and dopamine in the brain.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-70 with HIV who have been on antiretroviral treatment for at least 1 year

      Healthy adults ages 18-70

      All participants must be already enrolled in protocol 13-N-0149.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a urine drug test. The results could be shared with
           insurance companies.

        -  Participants who could be pregnant will have a pregnancy test.

        -  Participants may have a physical exam and blood tests.

        -  Participants will have 1 or 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans. A needle will
           guide a thin plastic tube (catheter) into an arm vein. A radioactive drug will be
           injected into the plastic tube. This is a tracer that helps researchers understand the
           PET images.

        -  Participants who have the dopamine scan will have to fast for 4-6 hours before the scan.
           They will take a pill to help direct the tracer to the brain one hour before the scan.

        -  Each scan will last about 1.5 hours.

        -  Participants will be asked to drink a lot of fluids and empty their bladder frequently
           for the rest of the day after each scan.

          3. A positive screening result for psychiatric diseases that are known to affect the
             dopaminergic or serotonergic systems.

          4. Current substance abuse that would interfere with PET scan results at the
             investigators discretion.

          5. Medications: use of any drug with known dopaminergic or serotonergic activity within 6
             months prior to planned imaging date(s).

          6. Pregnant or Lactating women: Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to study entry. Pregnancy testing
             will also be performed in enrolled female participants prior to any radiation
             exposure.

          7. Prior or planned/anticipated exposure to radiation due to clinical care or
             participation in other research protocols, which would exceed the recommended
             acceptable annual limit of radiation exposure once accounting for the requirements of
             the current study.

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for the Dopaminergic Arm (Groups A, B and C):

          1. Use of any of the following drugs within 6 months from planned imaging date(s):

               1. Haloperidol (increased intracerebral dopamine turnover caused by haloperidol may
                  result in increased accumulation of 18F-DOPA)

               2. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (may result in increased accumulation of
                  18F-DOPA in the brain)

      Background:

      HIV is a serious disease with no cure or vaccine to prevent it. Using antibodies could be a
      way to prevent HIV infection. Antibodies are made by the human body to fight germs.
      Researchers want to test an antibody, CAP256V2LS.

      Objective:

      To test CAP256V2LS to see if it is safe and how the body responds to it.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people, ages 18-60

      Design:

      Participants were screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. Some
      females had a pregnancy test.

      Participants were assigned to one of two groups. Based on their group, they got 1 dose of
      CAP256V2LS in 1 of 2 ways:

        -  Some participants got CAP256V2LS as an infusion. A thin tube was placed in an arm vein
           and CAP256V2LS was given into the vein using a pump.

        -  Some participants got CAP256V2LS injected under the skin. A small needle was used to
           inject CAP256V2LS into the fatty tissue of the belly, arm, or thigh. They got 1 to 4
           injections.

      On the day they got CAP256V2LS, participants gave blood samples at different time points.

      Participants were asked to check their temperature every day for 7 days after receiving
      CAP256V2LS. They used a tool to measure any redness, swelling, or bruising they may have at
      the site where they received the study drug.

      Participants had visits at least 2-3 times during the first week after they got CAP256V2LS.
      Then they had about 9 more visits over the next 6 months. Visits included blood tests.

      The proper control of acute and chronic pain is one of the most important areas in health
      care. Despite the profound advances in neuroscience over the past 20 years, the investigators
      still largely use opiate narcotics, much as was done in the Civil War. Total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed 1. While knee
      pain is often a complaint that precedes TKA, the procedure itself is associated with
      considerable post-operative pain lasting days to weeks. Adequate postoperative pain control
      is an important factor in determining recovery time and hospital length of stay. New
      analgesic strategies are needed that can be used adjunctively to existing strategies with the
      potential to reduce reliance on opioid analgesia. Several novel brain stimulation
      technologies including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct
      current stimulation (tDCS) are beginning to demonstrate promise as treatments for a variety
      of pain conditions. Electricity has no metabolite or other residue, and can be delivered with
      minimal discomfort and without problems associated with drug-drug interactions. In two
      independent preliminary pilot studies, the Investigators have shown that tDCS can reduce
      post-operative PCA use by as much as 46% while simultaneously reducing subjective pain
      ratings. The present study aims to determine the effects of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) on post-operative pain, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) use, and
      post-surgical complications during the 48-hour post-operative period following total knee
      arthroplasty.

      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) involves the narrowing of blood vessels connected to
      and within the lungs. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a focal adhesion-associated protein
      kinase involved in cellular adhesion and spreading processes which leads to stiffening and
      thickening of blood vessels in lungs. This further increases the blood pressure within the
      lungs and impairs their blood flow. This study aims to demonstrate biodistribution of FAK
      inhibitor, GSK2256098, in cardiopulmonary sites i.e. heart and lung tissues. The uptake of
      11C-radiolabelled GSK2256098 within the lung and / or heart of healthy subjects and
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) patients will be assessed using Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET). Based on study results the decision as to whether a follow-on
      phase 2 trial should be initiated to investigate the therapeutic utility of GSK2256098 in
      iPAH will be decided. Sufficient number of subjects will be screened (up to 30 days prior to
      scan) to enrol 12 healthy subjects and 12 PAH patients in the study. Enrolled subjects will
      receive a microdose of [11C]-GSK2256098 on a scanning day which will be followed by the
      follow-up visit (2-4 weeks post-last dose).

      Background:

      The human body uses antibodies as one way to help fight infection. VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS
      are antibodies directed against the HIV virus. Researchers want to see if they are safe and
      well tolerated. In Part A of the study, the researchers studied VRC01LS. Part A of the study
      was completed in 2017. In Part B, the researchers studied VRC07-523LS. Depending on which
      antibody received, researchers studied the amount of VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS in the body and
      how it changes over time. They evaluated the effect of antibodies on CD4+ (Cluster of
      Differentiation 4) lymphocyte count and HIV viral load, and checked to see if people who get
      VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS develop an immune response to it.

      Objective:

      To see if VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS are safe and well tolerated.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-70 who are HIV infected but otherwise healthy.

      Design:

      Participants received the study drug one time by IV infusion. A needle guided a thin tube
      into a vein. The study drug mixed with salt water was dripped into the vein over about 30
      minutes.

      Participants were monitored for 30 minutes after the infusion.

      Blood samples were taken at the following times:

        -  Once before the infusion

        -  5 times in the 4 hours after the infusion

        -  1 time 24 hours after infusion. Some participants may have had 3 optional blood draws in
           the time period between 4 and 24 hours.

      For 3 days after the infusion, participants recorded their temperature and reactogenicity
      symptoms in a diary.

      There were a total of 23 study visits over 48 weeks. Ten visits were in the first 4 weeks. At
      all visits, participants answered health questions and gave blood samples.

      Approximately 15,000 Veterans are hospitalized for stroke each year with new cases costing an
      estimated $111 million for acute inpatient, $75 million for post-acute inpatient, and $88
      million for follow-up care over 6 months post-stroke. Rehabilitation of walking ability
      contributes to these costs. To ""walk again"" is the number one stated goal for Veterans who
      have had a stroke. Teaching patients post-stroke to use their weak leg while they are
      regaining walking function and to not compensate by over-using their strong leg is necessary
      to restore safe, efficient walking ability. This project will determine if providing
      biofeedback (an audible tone) from pressure-sensitive shoe insole sensors, that encourage use
      of the weaker leg during walking training, in addition to therapists' feedback, will help
      Veterans regain use of their weak leg, improve their endurance and improve their balance when
      walking in challenging environments.

      This is a phase 1, open-label, randomized clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females,
      18 years of age and older, who are in good health, have no known history of COVID-19 or
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, and meet all other eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351
      manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc, given in vaccination schedules alone, sequentially, or
      coadministered with mRNA-1273. mRNA-1273.351 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated
      mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized S protein of the
      SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant. Enrollment will occur at approximately five domestic clinical
      research sites.

      This study includes two cohorts. Cohort 1 will provide rapid information about the
      immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351 in a previously vaccinated group. This cohort can inform near
      term public health decisions if the variant virus becomes more widespread. Cohort 2 will
      evaluate different strategies for generation of cross protective immune responses in a naïve
      population. This cohort will take longer to provide information on the immunogenicity of
      mRNA-1273.351, but is important to inform future public health strategies. Cohort 1 will
      include approximately 60 subjects 18 years of age and older who received two vaccinations of
      mRNA-1273 at dosages of 50 mcg, 100 mcg, or 250 mcg in the Phase 1 clinical trial (DMID
      20-0003). Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection of the
      designated vaccine and will be followed through 12 months after vaccination. Follow-up visits
      will occur on Days 8, 15, and 29, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months after the vaccination.
      Cohort 2 will include approximately 150 participants 18 through 55 years of age who have not
      received a COVID-19 vaccine, have no known history of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
      do not have underlying conditions that are associated with an increased risk of severe
      illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Enrollment may close before the full 150 participants
      based on estimates on the timing of immunogenicity results and the need to inform public
      health decisions. They will be randomly assigned to one of 8 treatment arms and will receive
      2 or 3 IM injections of the vaccine and followed through 12 months after the last
      vaccination. Follow-up visits will occur 7, 14, and 28 days after each vaccination, as well
      as 3, 6 and 12 months post the last vaccination.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273 and
      mRNA-1273.351 vaccines, in naïve and previously vaccinated individuals.

             a worsening of medical diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent
             to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided the change was not
             precipitated by deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and there is no
             anticipated additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of

      Background:

      - People with cancer can have a weak immune system as a result of the cancer itself, or from
      prior treatments. Still, treatments that stimulate the immune system have been shown to be
      effective against a number of different cancers. Recombinant human interleukin-15 (rhIL-15)
      is a drug that is designed to boost the immune system. Researchers are interested in seeing
      if rhIL-15 can strengthen the immune system's response against cancer. The drug will be given
      through a vein without a break for 10 days (240 hours).

      Objectives:

        -  To see rhIL-15 given as a continuous infusion over 10 days can be used to treat advanced
           cancer

        -  Identify the side effects associated with this treatment.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age with advanced cancer for which there are no effective
      treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants screening procedures will include a physical exam and medical history,
           laboratory (blood) tests and x-rays (Imaging studies) to determine suitability for the
           protocol.

        -  Appropriate participants with easily accessible tumor deposits may also be asked to have
           one pretreatment and one post (cycle 1) treatment tumor biopsy.

        -  Eligible participants will be admitted to the hospital for the rhIL-15 treatment and
           will spend about 12 days in the hospital.

        -  Participants will receive one 10 day infusion each cycle (about every 42 days) for as
           long as there are no serious side effects and the disease does not progress.

        -  Participants will continue treatment as long as imaging studies show that the tumor
           continues to shrink or for two additional cycles after it has disappeared from the
           x-rays to make that the cancer is completely gone.

        -  Participants who stop treatment for side effects or because their tumor did not shrink
           or stopped responding to the treatment will continue to have follow-up visits to monitor
           the outcome of the rhIL-15 treatment until there is evidence their cancer has progress
           or they begin another treatment.

      Unlike healthy control skin, the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is frequently
      colonized by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), putting these patients at increased risk of
      S. aureus skin infections. In addition, research in the investigator's lab has shown that
      these patients have fewer protective antimicrobial Staphylococcal species such as
      Staphylococcal epidermidis (S. epidermidis) that are known to produce antimicrobial peptides
      that play a role in protecting the skin from invading pathogens. In this study, the
      investigator will attempt to decrease S. aureus colonization and increase colonization by
      protective Staph species in AD patients. First the investigator will capture the bacteria on
      subjects' lesional AD skin. Next the investigator will selectively grow the subject's
      antimicrobial Staphylococcal colonies and place them into a base moisturizer. The moisturizer
      plus bacteria will be applied to one of the subject's arms, and the moisturizer alone
      (without bacteria) to the other arm. The investigator will then do a quantitative wash of the
      bacteria growing on each arm one day later in order to determine whether the S. aureus
      abundance was affected by the application of the transplanted bacteria.

We also use PaO2 (measured by arterial blood gas [ABG] analysis) as the ultimate goal rather than arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) measured by pulse oximetry because an SaO2 value <100% on pulse oximetry monitoring does not always exclude supranormal PaO2. The protocol in this application begins with very rapid reduction of FiO2 as much as possible according to SaO2 values, and when FiO2 is maximally reduced by SaO2 an ABG is measured, followed by finer adjustment of FiO2 to achieve a PaO2 60-99 mmHg.

             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin
             [HCG]).

         16. Female subjects of childbearing potential who were sexually active with a
             non-sterilized male partner must have used at least one highly effective method of
             contraception from the time of screening and must have agreed to continue using such
             precautions for 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or for 6 months after the
             final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Non-sterilized male
             partners of a female subject must have used male condoms plus spermicide throughout
             this period. Cessation of birth control after this point should have been discussed
             with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration
             of the trial and the drug washout period was an acceptable practice; however, periodic
             abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method were not acceptable methods
             of birth control.

             Female subjects should have also refrained from breastfeeding throughout the period
             described above.

             Females of childbearing potential were defined as those who were not surgically
             sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete
             hysterectomy) or post-menopausal.

             Females were considered post-menopausal if they had been amenorrheic for 12 months
             without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements applied:

               -  Females <50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                  treatments and if they had luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Females ≥ 50 years of age were considered post-menopausal if they had been
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or
                  hysterectomy).

             Non-sterilized male subjects who were sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must have used male condoms plus spermicide from screening
             through 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab or through 6 months after receipt of
             the final dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab (whichever was longer). Female partners
             (of childbearing potential) of a male subject must have used a highly effective method
             of contraception throughout this period. Cessation of birth control after this point
             should have been discussed with a responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual
             activity for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period was an
             acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
             withdrawal method were not acceptable methods of contraception.

             Male subjects should have refrained from sperm donation throughout the period
             described above.

             A highly effective method of contraception was defined as one that resulted in a low
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note
             that some contraception methods were not considered highly effective (e.g., male or
             female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or
             without spermicide; non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral
             hormonal contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of
             action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which was considered highly effective]; and
             triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills).

         17. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, was likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may have
             put the subject at unacceptable risk.

         18. Subjects must not have donated blood while on study and for at least 90 days following
             the last durvalumab treatment or 6 months after the last tremelimumab treatment,
             whichever was longer.

      Blood sugar levels are controlled by insulin, a hormone made by cells in the pancreas. After
      a meal, carbohydrates are broken down into glucose (blood sugar) which is absorbed from the
      intestine into the blood leading to a rise in glucose which triggers the secretion of
      insulin. Insulin binds to cells in the liver, muscle and fat, triggering them to take up
      glucose and bring the blood glucose level back to normal.

      A high blood sugar level is known as diabetes. The most common form of diabetes, type 2
      diabetes, is caused by insulin resistance; that is, a reduced ability of insulin to stimulate
      glucose uptake into cells. The body compensates for insulin resistance by making more
      insulin; type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas can no longer make enough insulin to
      control blood glucose. The high blood glucose and insulin levels lead to long-term
      complications such as heart attacks, kidney failure, reduced sensation and poor circulation
      in the feet and legs. Reducing blood glucose levels with oral medications and insulin reduces
      risk of diabetic complications. There are several types of oral medications available for
      treating diabetes; however, they do not always control blood glucose adequately. In addition,
      these drugs have complications and are not used to treat insulin resistance and prediabetes -
      a condition when blood glucose is higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as
      diabetes. Prediabetes often progresses to diabetes over a period of months or years.
      Effective and safe treatments for prediabetes could prevent or delay the onset of diabetes.

      Axulin is a natural health product consisting of a mixture of extracts - derived from herbs
      and vegetables present in normal diets - which has been shown in cell culture and in animal
      studies to increase the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake into cells. The active
      ingredient in Axulin is a botanical extract designated HP-211. Thus, HP-211 may reduce the
      blood glucose and insulin levels of subjects without diabetes after eating. HP-211 may also
      reduce glucose and insulin responses to a larger extent in insulin-resistant as compared to
      insulin-sensitive subjects.

      Subjects will take 0g, 2g, or 4g of capsules or tablets in the morning after an overnight
      fast; 40 minutes later they will consume 75g glucose dissolved in 300ml water. Blood glucose,
      insulin and fats will be measured before and for 2 hours after the glucose drink.

      Background:

      Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (MF/SS) are
      cancers that form in the T cells, a type of white blood cell that helps with the body's
      immune response. A combination of drugs might be able to better treat these cancers than
      existing therapies.

      Objective:

      To test if the drugs interleukin-15 (IL-15) and mogamulizumab are safe and effective to treat
      people with Adult T-Cell Leukemia and Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome (ATLL or MF/SS).

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with relapsed ATLL or MF/SS that has not responded to at least one
      standard treatment

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood (including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C), urine, lung, and
      heart tests

      Bone marrow tests (if needed): A needle inserted in the participants hip will take a small
      amount of marrow.

      Computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and/or magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans

      Tumor biopsy (if needed): A needle will take out a small piece of the participants tumor.

      Participants will get the study drugs by vein for up to six 28-day cycles. They will get
      IL-15 the first 5 days of each cycle. They will get mogamulizumab on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of
      cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of the other cycles. They will be hospitalized for 1 week in cycle
      1. They may need to get a midline catheter. This is a soft tube put into a vein leading to
      the heart.

      Participants will have repeats of the screening tests throughout the study.

      After treatment, participants will have visits every 60 days for 6 months, every 90 days for
      2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      In comparison to the general population, military personnel and veterans are at increased
      risk of developing both substance use disorders (SUDs) and post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). Despite promising developments in the past decade, the treatment of patients with
      SUDs and comorbid PTSD is woefully inadequate (Back, 2010; Back et al., 2014; Brady et al.,
      2007; McCauley et al., 2012). One of the adverse effects of abused drugs is their long-term
      negative impact on social behavior that is thought to involve oxytocin (OT) dysregulation
      (McGregor et al., 2008). In preclinical and clinical experiments, local, intra-nasal, or
      systemic OT administration decreases activation of the amygdala in response to visual
      fearful/threatening stimuli (Kirsch et al., 2005), ameliorates the effects of stressful
      events, and decreases drug-taking and seeking behavior (McGregor et al., 2008; Baskerville
      and Douglas, 2010; Carson et al., 2010a; Bowen et al., 2011; Cox et al 2013). However, little
      attention has been focused on whether OT decreases SUD vulnerability after exposure to
      traumatic stress in preclinical or clinical studies. This clinical project will determine
      whether intra-nasally administered OT will decrease craving (Aim 1) to use alcohol and
      decrease stress reactivity (Aim 2) following exposure to laboratory-induced stress (Trier
      Social Stress Task) among veterans with a dual diagnosis of alcohol use disorder and PTSD.

      Staphylococcal epidermidis (S. epidermidis) that are known to produce antimicrobial peptides
      that play a role in protecting the skin from invading pathogens. In this study, the

      protective Staph species in AD patients. First the investigator will capture the bacteria on
      subjects' skin. Next the investigator will selectively grow the subject's antimicrobial
      Staphylococcal colonies and place them into a base moisturizer. The moisturizer plus bacteria

      Background:

      Mesothelioma is cancer of the tissue that lines some organs. A new drug, LMB-100, may bind to
      a protein on mesothelioma tumors and kill cancer cells. But sometimes the body makes
      antibodies that reduce how well LMB-100 works. Researchers want to see if adding the drug
      SEL-110 to LMB-100 will prevent these antibodies from forming.

      Objective:

      To learn how safe and tolerable LMB-100 plus SEL-110 is in people with advanced mesothelioma.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older who have pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma that has not responded
      to prior platinum-based therapy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Sample of tumor tissue. This can be from a previous procedure.

        -  Scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Participants will lie on a table in a scanner
           that takes pictures. A special dye may be injected in a vein.

        -  Positron emission tomography (fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET))
           scan. A sugar attached to a chemical that gives off a signal will be injected before the
           scan.

        -  Heart function tests

      The study will be done in 21-day cycles. Participants will get the study drugs for up to 4
      cycles. They will get them through an intravenous (IV) catheter (a tube inserted in a vein,
      usually in the arm):

        -  LMB-100 for about 30 minutes on day 1, day 3, and day 5 of each cycle

        -  SEL-110 for about 1 hour on day 1 of each cycle

      Participants will get standard medicines to help prevent side effects.

      Participants will repeat some screening tests during each cycle and about 5 weeks after the
      last dose of study drug.

             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with LMB-100+SEL-110, breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with LMB-100+SEL-110. These potential risks may also apply to

      Background:

      Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the blood plasma cells. It usually becomes resistant to
      standard treatments. Researchers have developed a procedure called gene therapy. It uses a
      person's own T cells, which are part of the immune system. The cells are changed in a lab and
      then returned to the person. Researchers hope the changed T cells will be better at
      recognizing and killing tumor cells.

      Objective:

      To test the safety of giving changed T cells to people with multiple myeloma.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-73 who have been diagnosed with multiple myeloma that has not been controlled
      with standard therapies.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood tests

      Heart function tests

      Bone marrow sample taken by needle in a hip bone.

      Scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They may have a brain scan.

      Pregnancy test

      Participants will have apheresis. Blood will be removed through an arm vein. The blood will
      be separated, and T cells removed. The rest of the blood will be returned through a vein in
      the other arm.

      Participants will have a central line placed in a large vein in the arm or chest.

      Participants will get 2 chemotherapy drugs by the central line over 3 days.

      Two days later, participants will get the changed T cells by the central line. They will stay
      in the hospital at least 9 days.

      Participants must stay near the hospital for 2 weeks.

      Participants will have 8 follow-up visits over the next year for blood and urine tests. They
      may have scans.

      Participants blood will be collected regularly over the next several years.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Multiple Myeloma (MM) criteria:

          -  B Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) expression must be detected on malignant plasma cells
             from either bone marrow or a plasmacytoma by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry.
             If patient has plasmacytomas, one plasmacytoma must be biopsied to demonstrate BCMA
             expression. A specific quantitative level of BCMA expression for eligibility is not
             specified, but patients with multiple myeloma cells that are negative for BCMA by flow
             cytometry and immunohistochemistry on either bone marrow biopsy or plasmacytoma biopsy
             will not be enrolled. These assays must be performed at the National Institutes of
             Health (NIH). It is not required that the specimen used for BCMA determination comes
             from a sample that was obtained after the patients most recent treatment. If paraffin
             embedded unstained samples of bone marrow involved with MM or a plasmacytoma are
             available, these can be shipped to the NIH for BCMA staining, otherwise new biopsies
             will need to be performed for determination of BCMA expression.

          -  BCMA expression will need to be documented on the majority of malignant plasma cells
             by flow cytometry at the NIH at some time after the original anti-BCMA chimeric

          -  Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. (The experimental
             treatment being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system.
             Patients who are HIV seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus are
             less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

          -  A patient with a negative blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for hepatitis B
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test can be enrolled. If hepatitis B DNA (PCR) testing is

             hepatitis B core antibody can be enrolled.

          -  Patients must be tested for the presence of Hepatitis C antigen by PCR and be
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) negative in order to be eligible. Only
             if Hepatitis C PCR testing is not available in a timely manner, patients who are
             Hepatitis C antibody-negative can be enrolled.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mm(3) without the support of

             such as alopecia or vitiligo).

          -  Because this protocol requires collection of autologous blood cells by leukapheresis
             in order to prepare anti-BCMA-CAR T cells, systemic anti-myeloma therapy including
             systemic corticosteroid steroid therapy of greater than 5 mg/day of prednisone or

      Malaria has remained a major concern for the US military. During World War II, malaria was
      the leading cause of disease and non-battle injury with 500-700 men infected per day,
      resulting in 24,000 malaria-related casualties.(10) Currently, the methods used for
      protecting troops against malaria are insecticidal nets, clothing, and antimalarial
      treatment. To be effective, these methods must be self-administered and be used consistently,
      often unattainable in field or combat situations. The United States Army Medical Research and
      Development Command (USAMRMC), through the United States Army Medical Materiel Development
      Activity (USAMMDA) and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) are actively
      pursuing the development of an effective vaccine against P. falciparum malaria; development
      of such a vaccine is a high priority for the US military and other individuals who travel to
      endemic regions, and is equally important to populations residing in those areas.

      Vitreoretinal surgery for epiretinal proliferation tractional retinal detachment associated
      with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is often complicated by hemorrhage from
      fibrovascular tissue. To control the bleeding during tissue dissection multiple measures and
      techniques are used.

      Bevacizumab is an anti VEGF antibody which has been used to induce regression of ocular
      neovascularization. Its intraocular injection has been increasingly used for treatment of
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with age related macular degeneration (AMD)
      with fairly good success.Also it has been shown to be effective for treatment of PDR
      complicated with vitreous hemorrhage and iris neovascularization. We hypothesized that if
      anti-angiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab are injected into the vitreous cavity before
      vitrectomy in cases of PDR; there may be partial regression of neovascularization resulting
      in less intraoperative (and postoperative) hemorrhage. This can make the operation easier and
      shorter and lessen the need for intraocular cautery..

      In this study diabetic patients who are candidated for vitrectomy with similar complexity
      scores will be randomized to preoperative injection or no injection of 2.5 mg Bevacizumab .In
      the injection group, 2.5 mg of bevacizumab (0.1 ml of commercially available Avastin vial,
      Genentech, inc. South San Francisco, CA) will be injected into the vitreous 3-5 days before
      operation.

      During each operation, the number of endodiathermy applications, backflush needle
      applications and the duration of surgery will be recorded by an independent observer. Also,
      type of tamponade, post operation vitreous hemorrhage and 3 months postoperative visual
      acuities wil be recorded. all these parameters will be compared in two groups.

      This is a single-centre, open-label study using P. falciparum-induced blood stage malaria
      (IBSM) infection to assess the infectivity of sexual life cycle stages of the malaria
      parasite (gametocytes) to mosquito vectors. Previous clinical studies have shown that
      treatment of participants with the antimalarial drug piperaquine, in addition to effectively
      clearing asexual (pathogenic) stages of the malaria life cycle, induces the production of
      gametocytes in the blood. The propensity of piperaquine to induce gametocytemia will be
      employed in this study to assess gametocyte infectivity to Anopheles mosquitoes. For this
      purpose, experimental mosquito feeding directly on participants and artificial membrane
      mosquito feeding will be performed. The study will be conducted in 3 cohorts (n=2 per
      cohort). Subsequent cohorts will not commence until at least after day 28 of the previous
      cohort and review by Safety Review Team. This interval will also allow cohorting of
      experimental infection of mosquitoes to optimise logistics and enable iterative improvements
      in the system if applicable.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the highest and safest dose of the
      experimental drug veliparib when combined with nivolumab. We will also study how safely this
      combination of medication can be given in advanced cancer and lymphoma and benefits of
      receiving this therapy. Nivolumab is currently approved in certain cancers such as melanoma,
      lung cancer and kidney cancer. Veliparib is not yet approved for use in the United States,
      and is considered experimental. Veliparib inhibits (blocks) the activity of the enzyme PARP.
      This blocking activity may prevent the cancer cell from repairing itself and resume growing.
      Nivolumab increases T cells in your immune system, which allows your immune system to attack
      the cancer. We think the combination of these drugs will be more effective against your
      cancer.

      T cells, a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte, play an important role in the immune
      system. One subtype, the regulatory T cell (Treg) helps to regulate the immune system and may
      provide protection against the development of autoimmune disease. The hope is that these
      naturally occurring Treg cells can be utilized for the treatment of autoimmune disease and
      potentially replace the use of chronic immunosuppressive therapies that are associated with
      multiple side effects. There has been a small study showing safe administration of Tregs with
      decreased disease activity in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. Tregs are being

      Background:

      Malaria is caused by a parasite (a type of germ called P. vivax) that is carried by
      mosquitoes. The disease is transmitted to people when they are bitten by infected mosquitoes.
      To make drugs and vaccines for malaria, researchers need malaria-infected blood. Plasmodium
      vivax cell cultures are currently not cultured in vivo, and thus establishing a blood bank
      from P. vivax infections will be vital for future research.

      Objective:

      The goal of this study is to infect people with early-stage malaria, then collect infected
      blood samples to store in a cell bank for future use.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18-50 who will not be living alone during the study period.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, heart health test, and medical history.
      They will have blood and urine tests. They will take a mental health survey. They must pass
      an exam to prove they understand the study.

      Participants will have red blood cells infected with P. vivax injected into an arm vein. They
      will be observed for side effects. They will get a thermometer to measure their temperature
      at home.

      For the next 3 days, they will be monitored via phone call or text. Starting on day 4 after
      the infection, they will have daily study visits to give blood samples. They will likely
      develop symptoms of malaria, such as fever, chills, headache, and muscle pain.

      Participants will be admitted to the hospital for 2-3 days when either they develop symptoms
      or the daily blood tests detect a certain amount of parasites. Once malaria is confirmed, a
      sample of their blood will be collected for the cell bank. Then they will be treated for
      malaria with oral medication that will cure the infection. Those who do not develop malaria
      will begin treatment after 15 days.

      Participants will have follow-up visits 28 and 90 days after infection.

      Participation will last for 3-5 months.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety of the investigational agent,
      cirmtuzumab. Cirmtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody drug designed to attach to a protein,
      called ROR1, on the surface of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to block cell growth
      and survival. ROR1 is rarely expressed on healthy cells so the idea is to preferentially get
      rid of the cancer cells. Although there is evidence in laboratory animals that cirmtuzumab
      can decrease the number of CLL cells, the investigators do not know if this will work in
      humans. This drug will be given to humans for the first time in this study. Therefore, the
      goal of this study is to see if cirmtuzumab is safe and tolerated in study participants.

      Obesity causes 600 premature deaths per week in the UK and existing treatments are not
      effective. When humans eat, the bowels naturally secrete chemicals into the bloodstream which
      make people feel full and which stop eating. One of these chemicals is known as Peptide YY
      (PYY). The investigators have previously shown that injections of PYY reduce appetite and
      food intake in human volunteers. The investigators have now developed a very similar
      chemical, Y242, as a treatment for obesity. Y242 has been tested in animals and has been
      shown to be safe, to reduce their appetite, and to last for much longer than PYY itself. This
      study will test Y242 to ensure that it is well tolerated in humans, and to see how long it
      lasts in the blood stream after being injected under the skin. It will also look for any
      effects on appetite.

      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given together
      with pembrolizumab in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular
      lymphoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement or that does
      not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab,
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving vorinostat and pembrolizumab together may
      work better than pembrolizumab alone in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,

      Background:

      Ebola is a virus that has infected and killed people mostly in West Africa. There is no
      treatment or prevention for it, but several drugs are being studied. Researchers want to test
      the drug MAb114 in healthy people not exposed to Ebola to see whether it can be used for
      Ebola treatment in people who are infected in the future. This trial will not expose
      volunteers to the Ebola virus.

      Objectives:

      To see if MAb114 is safe and how a person's body responds to it.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18-60 who weigh 220.5 pounds or less

      Design:

      Participants will be screened under protocol NIH 11-I-0164 with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood or urine tests

      Participants will have a first 8- to10-hour visit. They will get MAb114 by IV infusion. For
      this, a thin tube will be placed in an arm vein. They may get an IV line in their other arm
      to collect blood. Blood will be taken many times before and after the infusion. Participants
      may have a urine test.

      Participants will get a thermometer to check their temperature for 3 days after they get
      MAb114. They will record their highest temperature and any symptoms.

      Participants will have about 14 more study visits over 6 months. At each visit, they will
      have blood taken and be checked for any health changes. They will talk about how they are
      feeling and if they have taken any medications.

      At the end of the 6 months, participants may be invited to take part in another study for
      follow-up sample collection.

      This study is being done to determine the role of a hormone, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1),
      on insulin secretion and to study how GLP-1 works in in diabetic individuals as compared to
      non-diabetic individuals, under fasting conditions.

      GLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone made in the intestines. It is released into the
      circulating blood after eating and helps to control the blood glucose levels by increasing
      insulin secretion by cells in the pancreas. However, the exact method by which GLP-1 causes
      insulin secretion and how GLP-1 activity is changed in diabetic persons remain unclear. This
      research is being done to address these questions and better understand the function of
      GLP-1.

      In this research, the investigators will use a synthetic form of Exendin-9 to determine the
      effects of GLP-1 on insulin secretion in diabetic and non-diabetic persons. Exendin-9 acts as
      a blocker of GLP-1 action, allowing us to study the specific effects of the GLP-1 hormone.
      Exendin-9 is an investigational compound, which means it is still being tested in research
      studies and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      In this study, the investigators will also use the drug Sitagliptin, which is an FDA-approved
      drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, use of Sitagliptin is
      considered investigational since it is not being used for treatment of diabetes but is
      instead being used to understand how GLP-1 works and to better understand how medications
      like Sitagliptin work in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Background:

      HIV affects millions of people. The disease may ""hide"" in the brain, even in people with
      well-controlled HIV without cancer. Then it may ""wake up"" and continue. The drug
      pembrolizumab uses the body's immune system to fight cells like cancer cells. It is approved
      to treat some cancers but not HIV. Researchers want to see if it is safe for HIV-positive
      people without cancer. This study is not for HIV treatment; only one dose of the drug will be
      used.

      Objective:

      To learn if the drug pembrolizumab, used to treat certain cancers, is safe for HIV-positive
      people.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older with HIV who are in another NIH protocol

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical and neurological exams

        -  Blood tests

        -  Lumbar puncture. The lower back will be numbed. A needle will remove fluid from between
           back bones.

        -  FDG-PET/CT. A radioactive sugar will be injected in a thin plastic tube (catheter)
           inserted in an arm vein. Participants will rest for an hour, urinate, then lie in the
           scanner. A mask will hold the head still.

        -  Leukapheresis. An optional procedure at baseline. White blood cells are removed from you
           using a serum cell separator machine

      Women who can become pregnant cannot take pembrolizumab. Men who take it must use 2 kinds of
      contraception.

      Participants will have up to 7 more visits, which repeat some screening tests.

      At 1 visit, participants will get one dose of pembrolizumab by catheter for 30 minutes. They
      will get allergy and pain medicines.

      At 2 visits, participants will have a brain MRI. They will get a contrast agent by catheter.
      They will lie in a metal cylinder that takes pictures for 1-2 hours. They will get earplugs
      for loud sounds.

      Background:

      - Radiation and chemotherapy treatments for anal cancer can cause irritation of the skin that
      can lead to redness and tenderness, and in some cases can be so severe that it results in
      blistering or peeling of the skin during treatment. These conditions cause discomfort and may
      require breaks from radiation treatment. Researchers are interested in determining whether
      MTS-01, a drug that protects cells and tissues from the effects of radiation, can be given
      before radiation treatment to prevent these side effects and reduce the irritation of the
      skin during chemotherapy and radiation for anal cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of topical MTS-01 given before radiation in the
      groin and gluteal cleft of patients receiving combined radiation and chemotherapy for anal
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with cancer of the anal canal
      and are eligible to receive radiation and chemotherapy treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests,
           imaging studies and physical examination of the anal canal, and biopsies as needed to
           evaluate eligibility for treatment.

        -  Participants will be scheduled for radiation and chemotherapy treatments on the
           following schedule:

        -  Radiation given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, with topical MTS-01 treatment on the skin
           in the groin areas and between the buttocks before each treatment

        -  Mitomycin C given intravenously on days 1 and 29 of treatment

        -  5-Fluorouracil given intravenously over 4 days (first week and fifth week) during
           radiation treatment

        -  Participants will be monitored throughout the treatment for side effects, with
           photographs of the treatment area and frequent blood tests.

        -  Following the end of radiation, participants will have followup visits for 1 year with
           blood tests and imaging studies to evaluate the response to treatment.
