      18 yrs of age being admitted to Grady Hospital in Atlanta, GA. Potentially vulnerable
      patients such as prisoners, children, and pregnant women will not be enrolled in the study.
      Study participants will be contacted in person by the study personnel once inclusion criteria
      are met. Written informed consent will be obtained in person while hospitalized. Once the
      patient is consented they will be given enoxaparin and blood samples will be drawn. The data
      collected will be from the electronic medical record which is accessed only with a username
      and password so it is not publicly available. The data will be identifiable upon collection
      and will be kept on a password protected file on a computer in a locked office. The data will
      be de-identified after data analysis and only the study personnel will have access to the
      code that links identifiers to subjects. A HIPAA waiver will be requested to access existing
      data in order to identify patients for enrollment. All data will be collected in an office in
      the hospital. The study participants' burden will be minimal and dependent only on time of
      consent process since morbidly obese patients would be receiving this blood sample collection
      regardless of their participation in the study.

      Spine surgery is one of the most common operative procedures in the United States. It is
      performed in the prone position (a patient laying on belly). Muscle relaxants are given for
      neuromuscular blockade often referred as paralysis for surgical exposure which is maintained
      until the patient is returned to the supine position (a patient laying on back) at the end of
      surgery. At the end of the surgery the paralysis is reversed with a drug (neostigmine). A new
      drug (sugammadex) has the ability to rapidly reverse the paralysis but it is not well

      Our long-term goal is to more precisely define the role of mass azithromycin treatments as an
      intervention for reducing childhood mortality. We propose a single multi-site

      azithromycin with those randomized to placebo. We hypothesize that mass azithromycin
      treatments will reduce childhood mortality.

      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver condition frequently associated
      with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and characterized by insulin resistance and hepatic fat
      accumulation. Liver fat may range from simple steatosis to severe steatohepatitis with
      necroinflammation and variable degrees of fibrosis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH). Up
      to 40% of patients with NAFLD develop NASH in recent series. Risk factors for progression to
      NASH are unclear, but appears to be more common and progress more rapidly in older
      individuals, and in the presence of obesity and T2DM. Because the VA population in San
      Antonio, Texas, frequently combine these risk factors for NASH it was felt that a study
      targeting this very high-risk population was needed.

      This study will establish the long-term efficacy (primary endpoint: liver histology) and
      safety of pioglitazone for the treatment of VA patients with T2DM and NASH. All patients
      diagnosed with NASH will be offered lifestyle modification/weight loss (current standard of
      care) while being randomized to pioglitazone, vitamin E or placebo for up to 3 years. We
      believe that in such a high-risk population for complications from NASH, a substantial
      benefit may be expected from early detection and treatment.

      Specifically, the arms are: a) pioglitazone + vitamin E; b) vitamin E + placebo of
      pioglitazone; c) placebo of both. Patients are randomized to one of these 3 arms, and
      followed in a double-blind fashion for up to 18 months. Patients are then offered to continue
      into an open-label phase with pioglitazone + vitamin E or vitamin E alone for another 18
      months.

      An isotonic solution, such as saline (0.9%, 300mOsm/L) or lactated ringer's (273 mOsm/L), is
      commonly used and safely proven for joint irrigation during arthroscopy. Arthroscopic fluid
      is usually pressurized to enable visualization through dilation of the joint or bursa and
      prevent bleeding from the microvasculature. It has been recommended that this pressure be
      maintained at 49mmHg or less below the systolic blood pressure to preserve the clarity of
      view. The combination of large amounts of pressurized irrigation solution and lengthy
      arthroscopic procedures may cause substantial tissue fluid retention. Thus, extravasation of
      irrigation fluid into the periarticular tissues is inevitable and may create technical
      difficulties as well as patient morbidity and complications. Previous investigators have
      reported complications including tracheal obstruction, post-operative airway edema and
      compromise leading to prolonged intubation, excess weight gain, neurologic injuries, skin
      necrosis, and fluid overload associated with excessive fluid extravasation and tissue
      retention. Furthermore, it has been shown that fluid accumulated during the operation is
      slowly released back into the systemic circulation. Although there is not a rapid change in
      circulating volume, there may be implications for elderly patients and those with multiple
      comorbidities during prolonged arthroscopic surgery. Therefore the investigators seek to
      determine if a hyperosmolar solution, similar to what is used in head trauma patients, can
      reduce the degree of fluid extravasation in knee arthroscopy. The investigators also seek to
      determine if a hyperosmolar solution has any effect on post-operative knee pain compared to
      the standard isotonic solution. The third objective is to determine if a hyperosmolar
      solution has any effect on post-operative pain medicine consumption compared to the standard
      isotonic solution.

      HIV associated neurological disorders (HAND), are a major problem even in ART treated people.
      HAND results from chronic inflammation which is largely attributed to expansion and
      activation of monocytes. These activated monocytes, some of which also carry virus to the
      brain, invade the CNS and release cytokines / chemokines resulting in further recruitment of
      monocytes, as well as release viral proteins which injure neurons and cause activation of
      other brain cells. Persistent monocyte/macrophage activation is thus a potential critical
      target for adjunctive therapy to treat or prevent HAND. The investigators therefore propose
      to study the effects of a statin drug (Atorvastatin), which has anti-inflammatory functions,
      on the monocyte activation status in ART treated HIV+ individuals.

      The investigators objectives are based on the hypothesis that Atorvastatin treatment will
      reduce the inflammatory and activated phenotype and function of monocytes which have been
      linked to HIV associated neuropathogenesis and occur in HIV infected subjects despite ART. In
      this study the investigators propose to

      1) define the effect of Atorvastatin on monocyte activation in HIV infected / ART treated
      subjects in a double blind, placebo controlled crossover study

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Symptomatic therapy is
      primarily aimed at restoring dopamine function in the brain. Oral selegiline in conjunction
      with L-dopa has been a mainstay of therapy for PD patients experiencing motor fluctuations
      for many years. The mechanisms accounting for selegiline's beneficial adjunctive action in
      the treatment of PD are not fully understood. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B
      (MAO-B) activity is generally considered to be of primary importance.

      Oral selegiline has low bio-availability and is typically dosed BID, for a total of 5-10 mg
      daily. Recently, the FDA approved a new orally disintegration tablet (ODT) formulation of
      selegiline, called ZelaparTM. This new formulation utilizes Zydis technology to dissolve in
      the mouth, with absorption through the oral mucosa, thereby largely bypassing the gut and
      avoiding first pass hepatic metabolism. This allows more active drug to be delivered at a
      lower dose. Consequently, Zelapar is dosed once-daily, up to 2.5 mg per day. There are no
      empirical data indicating whether the use of the new approved formulation of selegiline ODT
      (Zelapar) is superior or preferred by patients compared to traditional oral selegiline. It is
      believed that clinical efficacy will be preserved or enhanced, by delivering more active
      drug, with improved patient preference for the ODT formulation due to the once-daily dosing .

      The effectiveness of orally disintegrating selegiline as an adjunct to carbidopa/levodopa in
      the treatment of PD was established in a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial
      (n=140; 94 received orally disintegrating selegiline, 46 received placebo) of three months'
      duration. Patients randomized to orally disintegrating selegiline received a daily dose of
      1.25 mg for the first 6 weeks and a daily dose of 2.5 mg for the last 6 weeks. Patients were
      all treated with levodopa and could additionally have been on dopamine agonists,
      anticholinergics, amantadine, or any combination of these during the trial. At 12 weeks,
      orally disintegrating selegiline-treated patients had an average of 2.2 hours per day less
      ""OFF"" time compared to baseline. Placebo treated patients had 0.6 hours per day less ""OFF""
      time compared to baseline. These differences were significant (p < 0.001). Adverse events
      were very similar between drug and placebo.

      The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of the medication named
      lubiprostone plus a large volume liquid laxative versus placebo which is a look alike

      bowel cleaning preparation for colonoscopy to see the colon better during the colonoscopy to
      identify abnormal growths such as polyps or colon cancer.

      Colonoscopy is considered the best way to screen for colon cancer screening because you can
      visualize the colon directly and remove or biopsy abnormal growths. The limiting step in the
      procedure is the quality of the colon preparation prior to the procedure. Many patients do
      not tolerate large volumes of liquid used to prepare the colon. The purpose of the study is
      to improve the quality of the prep by adding a pill laxative medication before starting the
      large volume laxative to better see the colon. The other aim of the study is to try to reduce
      the amount of of liquid laxative the patient has to drink by giving a pill laxative before
      starting the liquid laxative.

      Postpartum hemorrhage remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide,
      even in high income countries. Uterine atony is estimated to cause 70-80% of postpartum
      hemorrhage. Prolonged labor and augmented labor are known risk factors for postpartum
      hemorrhage. In attempts to reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, particularly in
      patients with known risks factors, it is essential to optimize preventative practices in
      order to reduce the rates postpartum hemorrhage.

      Although oxytocin is considered the first line therapy for preventing and treating uterine
      atony, early consideration of additional prophylactic uterotonic agents may be indicated in
      women with prior oxytocin exposure given oxytocin receptor desensitization and down
      regulation.

      As such, investigators sought to examine whether multimodal prophylactic uterotonics
      (standard oxytocin + methylergonovine), in patients who are increased risk of developing
      postpartum hemorrhage (specifically laboring patients who ultimately require a cesarean
      section) would benefit from the addition of prophylactic uterotonics. The clinical rational
      for administration of multimodal prophylactic uterotonics at the time of cesarean delivery in
      laboring patients is three-fold: to decrease the incidence of uterine atony, to decrease the
      incidence of postpartum hemorrhage, decrease the number of uterotonics required at the time
      of cesarean section.

      The primary outcome will be to evaluate the need for additional uterotonic agents
      (Methylergonovine, Carboprost, Misoprostol) at the time of delivery.

      Secondary outcomes will include the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (quantitative blood
      loss >1 liter), surgical assessment of uterine tone four minutes following delivery of the
      placenta, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin, the need for a blood transfusion,
      intensive care unit admission, uterine infection (endometritis).

      Anaemia in dialysis patients requires treatment with frequent dose adjustments. There are two

      haemoglobin, but these markers are known to be inaccurate. The current clinical protocol
      therefore tends towards overuse of both agents which can be associated with toxicity, and the
      reliance on these markers prevents retrospective assessment of treatment responsiveness. This

      Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a refractive error correction procedure that helps
      eliminate or reduce the dependence on corrective lenses. An important aspect of PRK is
      post-operative pain management. Post-operative pain can be significant in the first three to
      five days and is typically controlled utilizing various modalities including narcotic pain
      medication. Simple observation suggests a difference in the post-operative pain levels of
      patients utilizing the more potent oxycodone- versus the less potent codeine-containing
      acetaminophen preparations. There have been no studies performed to explore any differences
      in perceived pain comparing these two medications when used following PRK. This study is
      designed to answer this question by means of a pain survey conducted in the first five days
      post-op. This may help better manage similar patients in the future.

      A continuous peripheral nerve block-also termed ""perineural local anesthetic

      to a peripheral nerve, followed by local anesthetic (numbing medicine) administration via the
      catheter, providing pain control following surgery. Continuous peripheral nerve blocks may be
      provided in the hospital setting, but the use of lightweight, portable pumps permits infusion
      at home as well. However, it remains unknown if the concentration of the local anesthetic
      influences the block effects; or, is it rather simply the total dose of medication that is
      important. If it is the latter, then the concentration of local anesthetic could be
      increased, allowing a decreased basal infusion rate, which would allow patients at home to
      receive twice the duration of potent pain control since their infusion pump local anesthetic
      reservoir would last twice as long as current practice. In addition, if one
      concentration/dose combination results in less muscle weakness, but with at least equivalent

      Unlike heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) where several medicines and
      devices have been demonstrated to reduce mortality, no such therapies have been identified in
      HFpEF. This may be in part due to incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms of
      HFpEF.

      Recently, impaired myocardial blood flow, reduced myocardial energy utilization, and
      increased myocardial fibrosis have been postulated to play important pathophysiologic roles
      in HFpEF. The investigators and others have demonstrated that HFrEF may be associated with
      altered myocardial energy utilization and ""energy starvation."" However, there are limited
      data regarding ""energy starvation"" in HFpEF and the relationships between myocardial blood
      flow, energy utilization, and fibrosis in HFpEF are largely unknown. Therefore, the purposes
      of this study are to use non-invasive cardiac imaging techniques to describe cardiac
      structure, function, blood flow, energetics, and fibrosis, and the relationships between
      these in order to better understand underlying mechanisms in HFpEF.

      Many gynecologic, urologic and pelvic reconstructive surgeries require accurate ways to
      identify the opening of the ureters to ensure that they are working correctly. Historically,
      indigo carmine, an intravenous medication that dyes the urine blue, has been used to help
      visualize the opening of the ureters with cystoscopy which is a camera placed inside the
      bladder. In June 2014, the FDA announced there was current shortage of indigo carmine. Thus,
      investigators need to evaluate other methods for assessing ureteral patency. Ideal
      alternatives are agents that are low-risk, inexpensive, provide comparable visualization, are
      readily available and are easy to use.

      Examples of such agents currently being used to evaluate the ureters, include oral pyridium,
      IV sodium fluorescein, and mannitol. These agents help identify the opening of the ureters by
      either dyeing the urine a different color such as pyridium and sodium fluorescein, or by
      having a different viscosity to urine such as mannitol. This study will compare three methods
      of evaluating ureteral patency at time of cystoscopy compared to no method: mannitol, sodium
      fluorescein, and pyridium.

      To date there is very little PD and pharmacokinetic (PK) data on the ticagrelor 60 mg bid
      dosing regimen. In particular, there is no prospective PK/PD study on this dosing regimen in
      patients with DM who are known to have impaired response to clopidogrel therapy. Since DM
      patients frequently require elective PCI due to chronic progression of CAD (and not solely

      recommended P2Y12 inhibiting therapy for these patients, understanding the PD effects of the

      The objectives of this project are to determine if the bioavailability and release pattern of
      bupropion HCl products differ and if the genotype of the metabolic enzymes affects the
      saturation of intestinal enzymes with different dose strengths within one product line.
      Findings from this project will help the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER)
      Office of Generic Drugs improve policy development and review practice in the future for
      similar products, e.g. extended release oral drug products being metabolized in the gut wall
      and having multiple strengths.

      Aim 1: To compare the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its metabolites in plasma in healthy
      individuals when they ingest different strengths of bupropion (75-300 mg) with variable
      release profiles (IR vs XL vs SR) in GI tract.

      Working hypothesis: Variation in release rate and mechanism of bupropion formulations in
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract will impact metabolism and saturation of bupropion in GI tract,
      which will generate different concentration of bupropion and its metabolites in plasma.

      Aim 2: To investigate pharmacogenomics of CYP 2B6 that influences metabolism, saturation, and
      pharmacokinetics of bupropion

      Working hypothesis: The gain of function of CYP2B6 variants (allele *4 and *22) in patients
      will increase the metabolism of bupropion in the GI tract and liver, reduce both local
      concentration and plasma concentration of bupropion, and thus cause non-bioequivalence when
      bupropion is released earlier in GI tract

                  WOCBP, are expected to use one of the highly effective methods of contraception
                  listed below. Male subjects must inform their female partners who are WOCBP of
                  the contraceptive requirements of the protocol and are expected to adhere to
                  using contraception with their partner.

                    1. Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
                       ovulation.

                    3. Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard

                    4. Bilateral Tubal occlusion

                    5. Vasectomized partner with documented azoospermia 90 days after procedure

               2. Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that
                  partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the
                  vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.

               3. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)

                  heterosexual intercourse

                    1. complete abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all study
                       drugs and must be used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus
                       5 half-lives of the investigational drug plus 30 days).

                    2. It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete
                       abstinence is elected.

                    3. Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy
                       tests

                    4. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be
                       discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete
                       abstinence.

                    5. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to
                       the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                       the subject.

      Genital herpes (GH) is a commonly occurring sexually transmitted disease caused by herpes
      simplex virus (HSV). There are two types of HSV, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2); both can
      cause GH, although the latter is much more likely to produce frequent recurrences of GH
      lesions. Evidence suggests that there are advantages to using suppressive vs. episodic
      treatment, which include increased intervals between the pain and discomfort of genital
      herpes recurrences. Therefore, this study will collect safety and efficacy data on
      suppressive therapy with valaciclovir in subjects newly diagnosed with HSV-2 genital herpes.

      RATIONALE: Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) can cause cancer. Zidovudine is an
      antiviral drug that acts against the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1. Giving
      zidovudine, interferon alfa-2b, and PEG-interferon alfa-2b together may stimulate the immune
      system and slow down or keep the cancer cell from growing.

      Urinary urgency is a key symptom of overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) and may be more
      bothersome to a patient than the symptom of urinary frequency. Unfortunately, controversy
      continues to surround the term 'urgency' and there is no good tool to evaluate the severity
      of urgency. This fact has constrained the performance of clinical research in this field. The
      cause of urinary urgency is not fully understood and may vary from patient to patient.

      Although clinicians regularly obtain measures of bladder sensation during cystometry, little
      attention has been paid to the patient experience of urinary urgency. In this study, the
      researchers will use a non-significant risk device (i.e., an Urgeometer) to measure urinary
      urgency in women with overactive bladder.

      Despite the considerable use of oral steroids in the regular management of benign vocal fold
      lesions there is little evidence base in the literature. This study will investigate the
      efficacy of oral steroids for the treatment of vocal fold lesions in a controlled manner. The
      specific aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of of a short course of oral
      steroids prior to behavioral voice therapy in patients with benign, phonotraumatic vocal fold
      lesions. Enrolled subjects will be randomized using a random numbers table to either receive
      oral steroids or no steroids prior to the initiation of voice therapy. The therapist and
      individuals involved in the collection and analysis of data will be blinded as to whether the
      subject received drug. Prior to initiation of therapy subjects will be asked to return for an
      interval evaluation during which they undergo videostroboscopy and voice evaluation. Subjects
      will enter then the voice therapy phase . After an initial evaluation to determine the best
      mode of therapy they will receive a behavioral voice therapy course, which includes a range
      of behavioral modifications and motor learning techniques, along with lifestyle measures. In
      all these phases acoustic and aerodynamic measurements will be collected as well as
      audio-visual material from the videostroboscopic exams. The investigators hypothesize that
      oral steroids will lead to a reduction in lesion size, which will substantially aid in the
      delivery and incorporation of voice therapy techniques, contributing to the improvement of
      overall laryngeal biomechanics and providing an ideal starting point for behavioral voice
      therapy.

      Opioid analgesics are the most common postoperative pain medications used among dentists in
      the United States.Although these medications are highly effective in the postoperative dental
      pain management, not all patients optimally benefit from this therapy. Many suffer adverse
      consequences such as nausea, emesis, and psychomotor impairment, and there is a high
      prevalence of opioid prescription misuse among substance abusers within the dental patient
      population.

      The use of non-opioid analgesics including ibuprofen and acetaminophen in the management of
      postoperative dental pain has demonstrated equivalent or superior analgesic effects compared
      to opioid analgesic therapies, typically with significantly less adverse effects.However,
      despite these results, dentists have encountered a high variability in the success of
      non-opioid analgesic responses among the postoperative dental pain population.Thus, new
      strategies for earlier recognition of analgesic responses for pain medications is fundamental
      in the field of dentistry. Therefore, this study will evaluate the clinical utility of
      pharmacogenomic testing in acute postoperative dental pain management among healthy adults
      who undergo extraction of impacted mandibular third molar.

      Morphine is the opioid used to treat pain after surgery. Acetaminophen (called APAP) can
      reduce the amount of opioids needed for this.

      The problem is that morphine slows down digestion. That can delay pain relief from APAP
      pills. It can even change what the body does to the drug [pharmacokinetics (PK)].

      Some doctors have started using intravenous (IV) APAP with morphine, instead of the pills.

      This study will measure the PK of APAP pills and IV when used with morphine in healthy
      volunteers.

      IV APAP will likely be more effective and cause fewer side effects when used with morphine to
      treat pain after surgery.

      Several studies have shown that high blood sugar (glucose) levels are associated with
      diseases caused by diabetes. Controlling the glucose may prevent these complications. As
      people age, their bodies become unable to make enough insulin to control the blood sugars.
      Pills used to treat diabetes may help for a while, but many times this does not last. When
      the blood sugar is too high, insulin is frequently recommended and used to treat diabetes.
      Insulin is often started by adding a long-acting insulin to the medicines a patient already
      takes. In this study, glargine insulin will be taken together with the diabetes pills
      currently being used. Glargine is a long-acting insulin which is given under the skin once a
      day. Glargine is approved for use in the treatment of patients with diabetes by the FDA (Food
      and Drug Administration).

      Currently, insulin delivery is only available as a shot. The purpose of this study is to
      compare how satisfied patients are when using two different types of insulin shots.
      Specifically, this study aims to determine if people over 65 years old are more satisfied
      taking insulin shots by pens or syringes. Everyone who joins in this study will have a chance
      to use the insulin syringes and the insulin pens.

      The ability of patients to give themselves shots can affect how well the sugar is controlled.
      As people age, medical and other problems may develop that affect their ability to do certain
      things. Another aim of this study is to determine if the ability to use an insulin pen and
      insulin syringe is affected by age or some other problem.

      During this study, participants will be treated with insulin given by a syringe for 12 weeks
      and by a pen for 12 weeks. Questionnaires will be given to determine satisfaction with
      treatment throughout the study. The investigators hypothesize that among elderly patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus failing oral agent therapy, treatment with basal insulin via a
      pen device results in higher treatment satisfaction scores and more accurate dosing than
      treatment with basal insulin via conventional vial and syringe methods.

      A total of 56 subjects with type 2 diabetes will be recruited into this study. The site for
      the study is Grady Memorial Hospital clinics in Atlanta, Georgia.

      Psoriasis vulgaris is a common inflammatory condition of the skin that results in scaly red
      itchy plaques. In addition to affecting the skin, psoriasis can also cause disease in the
      finger and toe nails. The most characteristic nail findings associated with nail psoriasis
      are nail pitting, onycholysis with a rim of erythema, and oil spots. Because nail psoriasis
      causes a substantial disease burden for patients, it is critical that safe and effective
      treatments are found for this specific type of psoriasis. Unfortunately, nail psoriasis is
      often difficult to treat.

      Apremilast is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) that
      is FDA approved for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast has shown
      promising results for treating psoriatic arthritis and nail disease; however more data is
      needed regarding its effect on nail psoriasis (Kavanaugh, et al). We hypothesize that
      apremilast will prove to be highly effective in treating nail psoriasis. We propose to
      conduct an open label clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of
      apremilast in treating nail psoriasis, where we will follow the package insert guidelines for
      treating patients with apremilast.

      Atherogenic Dyslipidemia (AD) is a risk-conferring lipid/lipoprotein profile that comprises a
      higher proportion of small LDL particles, reduced HDL-C, and increased triglycerides. It is
      characteristically seen in patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and has emerged as an important marker for the increased
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk observed in these populations.

      Optimal cardiovascular risk reduction in patients exhibiting the lipid triad of AD requires
      integrated pharmacotherapy to normalize HDL-C, Triglyceride (TG) and LDL-C levels. Recent
      studies have focused on optimizing treatment for AD and compare the efficacy and tolerability
      of combined lipid-altering drug based therapies, however, an optimal pharmacologic approach
      has not yet been established.

      The present study was intended to evaluate the restorative efficacy of Extended Release
      Niacin (ER Niacin) and Fenofibrate as mono and combination therapies , as well as their
      safety and tolerability in females with obesity-induced AD.

      Globally, childhood mortality has shown a promising downward trend in recent years, however,
      many sub-Saharan countries still have relatively high child mortality rates. In previous
      studies within Niger, Tanzania, and Malawi, mass azithromycin treatment to children aged 1-59
      months old effectively reduced all-cause childhood mortality. A similar study will be
      conducted in Burkina Faso to replicate the results of mass azithromycin treatment.

      The investigators propose an individually randomized placebo-controlled trial alongside the
      MORDOR II Burkina Faso trial to evaluate the effect of a single dose of azithromycin (20
      mg/kg) on potential mediators of the effect of azithromycin on all-cause mortality. Many
      questions surround the mechanism behind azithromycin's effect on reducing childhood
      mortality. Further questions exist regarding antibiotic resistance and how mass antibiotic
      administration can impact intestinal microflora. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the
      changes in the gut microbiome after antibiotic administration and to measure the growth of
      children after receiving a single dose of azithromycin. Additionally we will measure
      resistance markers, inflammatory markers, and IgA-bound bacteria. We hypothesize that a
      single dose of azithromycin will lead to a significant increase in child growth and that the
      gut microbiome will be significantly different in children who received azithromycin compared
      to those who received placebo.

      Objectives:

        1. . To determine the effect of a single dose of azithromycin for children aged 8 days-59
           months on longitudinal changes in the intestinal microbiome over a 6-month period. We
           hypothesize that a single dose of azithromycin will result in a significant difference
           in the intestinal microbiome within the treatment group compared to the placebo group
           after a 6-month period within children ages 8 days-59 months.

        2. . To determine the effect of a single dose of azithromycin for children aged 8 days-59
           months on child growth over a 6-month period. We hypothesize that a single dose of
           azithromycin will increase child growth over a 6-month period in children aged 8 days-59
           months.

        3. . To determine the effect of a single dose of azithromycin for children aged 8 days to
           59 months on the presence of macrolide genetic resistance determinants within the first
           two weeks post-treatment. The investigators hypothesize that a single dose of
           azithromycin will increase the presence of macrolide resistance determinants over a 2
           week period in children aged 8 days to 59 months.

      The study will be conducted in Nouna Town in northwestern Burkina Faso.

      Patients who have undergone coronary bypass surgery have had a vein removed from the leg and
      implanted in the chest to ""bypass"" blockages in the coronary arteries. These veins are called
      saphenous vein grafts or SVGs. SVGs often develop blockages that can cause chest pain and
      heart attacks. SVG blockages can be opened by using small balloons and stents (metal coils
      that keep the artery open). Two types of stents are currently used: bare metal stents (BMS)
      and drug-eluting stents (DES). Both BMS and DES are made of metal. DES are also coated with a
      drug that releases into the wall of the blood vessel to prevent scar tissue from forming and
      re-narrowing the vessel. Both stents have advantages and disadvantages: DES require taking
      special blood thinners (called thienopyridines, such as clopidogrel or prasugrel) longer than
      bare metal stent and could have more bleeding but are also less likely to renarrow. Both BMS
      and DES are routinely being used in SVGs, but it is not known which one is better. Neither
      bare metal (except for an outdated model) nor drug-eluting stents are FDA approved for use in
      SVGs. The purpose of CSP#571 is to compare the outcomes after DES vs. BMS use in SVGs.

      BMS in a 1:1 ratio. Per standard practice, patients will receive 12 months of an open label
      thienopyridine if they have acute coronary syndrome (ACS), or if they have another clinical
      reason for needing the medication. Patients without ACS who receive DES also need to take 12
      months of a thienopyridine whether or not they are in the study, but non-ACS patients who
      receive a BMS do not. In order to make sure patients do not know which stent they received,
      non-ACS patients who received BMS will receive 1 month of open label thienopyridine followed
      by 11 months of blinded placebo, while those who received DES will receive 1 month of open
      label thienopyridine followed by 11 months of blinded clopidogrel, which is a thienopyridine.

      All study patients will be followed in the clinic for at least 1 year after their stenting
      procedure to see if there is a difference in the rate of cardiac death, heart attack, or any
      procedure that is required in order to increase the flow of blood to and from the heart
      between the BMS and DES groups.

      The Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatoide Artritis (CoBRA) trial was a milestone in the
      development of the present treatment paradigm for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This study
      introduced the principle of fast remission induction by means of a combination of standard
      Disease Modifying AntiRheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) and a step down bridge therapy with high dose
      glucocorticoids in early Rheumatoid Arthritis.

      The purpose of the present study is to compare different combinations of traditional DMARDs
      and glucocorticoids, based on the original CoBRA protocol, for treatment of early Rheumatoid
      Arthritis.

      Clopidogrel is an anti-platelet medication approved by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration
      (FDA) for use in patients who undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) with coronary
      stent implantation. Anti-platelet medications work to prevent blood clots from forming. Some
      studies have suggested that patients who have a certain genetic liver enzyme abnormality
      (known as cytochrome P450 2C19 [CYP2C19] *2 or *3 allele) may have a reduced ability to
      activate clopidogrel, and therefore may have a lowered response to clopidogrel. It is thought
      that perhaps people who have a coronary stent procedure may have this genetic liver enzyme
      abnormality. There is a research genetic test available to determine whether or not someone
      has this genetic liver enzyme abnormality. Ticagrelor, is a newer anti-platelet drug that is
      not dependent on the CYP2C19 liver enzyme for its activation and hence in poor clopidogrel
      metabolizers, alternative drugs like Ticagrelor have been recommended for use as an
      anti-platelet agent after PCI. The purpose of this study is to determine if genetic testing
      can identify the best anti-platelet therapy, for patients who undergo a coronary stent
      placement and do not activate clopidogrel very well.

      Cervical preparation with osmotic dilators is commonly used prior to dilation and evacuation
      (D&E) procedures to decrease the risk of complications. Women have described the pain of
      osmotic dilator insertion as moderate to severe yet there have been few studies aimed at
      addressing pain during and after osmotic dilator insertion. In addition to the discomfort
      during insertion, pain after osmotic dilator insertion peaks at 2 hours post-insertion with
      use of a lidocaine paracervical block. One randomized trial found that use of a paracervical
      block with 1% buffered lidocaine decreased pain with osmotic dilator insertion compared to a
      sham block. There are adjunct treatments to optimize analgesia with local anesthetics at a
      variety of anatomic locations. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, has been
      found to increase the quality of the anesthetic at the time of administration and increase
      the duration of nerve block analgesia at several anatomic sites, though has never been
      studied as an adjunct in a paracervical block. This has been used extensively in orthopedic
      surgery with significant prolongation of the local anesthetic effect by almost threefold in
      some studies.

      Primary Aim: To compare the mean pain score at the time of osmotic dilator insertion among
      women randomized to a 1% lidocaine and buprenorphine paracervical block compared to a 1%
      lidocaine paracervical block alone.

      Secondary Aim: To compare the mean pain score 2 hours after osmotic dilator insertion among
      women randomized to a lidocaine and buprenorphine paracervical block compared to a lidocaine
      paracervical block alone.

      The investigators hypothesize that in patients undergoing osmotic dilator insertion in
      preparation for dilation and evacuation, the addition of buprenorphine 0.15mg to a 1%
      lidocaine paracervical block will be associated with lower mean pain scores at time of
      osmotic dilator insertion compared to women who receive a 1% lidocaine paracervical block
      alone.

      The recommended antiplatelet treatment regimen for patients affected by acute coronary
      syndromes (ACS) and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) consists in the
      combination of aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. More potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitors,
      such as ticagrelor, have been developed which are associated with less response variability
      than clopidogrel and better clinical outcomes. Ticagrelor use has increased significantly
      because of its more expanded Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications compared with
      prasugrel. However, despite the evidence for sustained efficacy and safety, many physicians
      limit treatment duration with ticagrelor to the early phases following an ACS mostly due to
      cost issues and concerns about increased bleeding. Therefore, it is very common in clinical
      practice to switch patients while on maintenance dosing (MD) with ticagrelor to treatment
      with clopidogrel. However, the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of switching from ticagrelor to
      clopidogrel remain unknown. Therefore, the aim of this investigation is to evaluate the PD
      effects of switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel.

      Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, more frequently
      clopidogrel, represents the standard of care for the long-term secondary prevention of
      atherothrombotic events in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) or peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD). However, rates of ischemic recurrences remain high. Vorapaxar is a
      protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 inhibitor, which exerts potent inhibition of
      thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation. Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are known to be
      at increased risk of recurrent atherothrombotic events, which translates into worse outcomes,
      despite the use of standard of care therapy. This is in part due to the hyperreactive
      platelet phenotype, which characterizes DM patients, and to inadequate response to oral
      antiplatelet agents, including clopidogrel. Therefore, vorapaxar is an attractive treatment
      option for DM patients with a prior MI. The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of vorapaxar in DM
      patients and how these may differentiate from non-DM patients has not been explored. Further,
      the role of vorapaxar as part of a dual antithrombotic treatment regimen combined with
      clopidogrel (and stopping aspirin) represents another important area of clinical interest.
      The proposed prospective, parallel-design study conducted in patients post-MI or with PAD
      with and without DM will aim the assess the pharmacodynamic effects of vorapaxar in addition
      to standard DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel as well as in combination with clopidogrel only
      following aspirin withdrawal.

      Administration of concomitant antibiotics (CA) is a known risk factor for treatment failure
      in the treatment of CDI, as well as for recurrence of CDI. Recent data suggested that among
      patients receiving CA, fidaxomicin is superior to vancomycin. While these data are
      encouraging, many clinicians remain unclear on how to apply these data to patient care.
      Additionally, patients were excluded from the trials presented to the FDA if it was expected
      that they would require â¥ 7 days of CA. Therefore, the clinical question still remains of how
      to apply these data to the real world patient who requires a long course of CA and develops
      CDI while on therapy. We therefore propose an open label, comparative and prospective study
      of fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily vs oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for the
      treatment of CDI among patients who are receiving a long course of CA.

      Children who receive general anesthesia may become agitated (emergence delirium) in the
      recovery period. This occurs more often after inhalational anesthetics, particularly
      sevoflurane and desflurane than after propofol. However, agitation after anesthesia in
      children may be difficult to distinguish from pain; accordingly studies are ideally designed
      during MRI to obviate the contribution of pain during emergence. Airway complications have
      been reported after LMA and isoflurane more commonly than with IV propofol and nasal prongs.
      Whether the airway complications were due to the LMA or the isoflurane was unclear.
      Therefore, this study was designed to study the incidence of 1. agitation after sevoflurane
      compared with IV propofol and 2. airway complications after LMA or nasal prongs.

      Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor represents the
      standard of care for the long-term secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in
      patients with myocardial infarction (MI). However, rates of ischemic recurrences remain high,
      which may be in part due to the fact that other platelet signaling pathways, such as
      thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, continue to be activated. Vorapaxar is a
      protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 inhibitor, which exerts potent inhibition of
      thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation. It is approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a
      history of MI or with peripheral arterial disease. However, to date clinical trial experience
      with vorapaxar has been almost exclusively with the P2Y12 receptor inhibitor clopidogrel and
      the effects of vorapaxar in combination with antiplatelet therapy including prasugrel or
      ticagrelor, is largely unexplored. Further, the role of vorapaxar as part of a dual
      antithrombotic treatment regimen, in addition to a novel P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, with
      withdrawal of aspirin, represents another important area of clinical interest as it has the
      potential to maximize ischemic protection while reducing the risk of bleeding. The proposed
      prospective, randomized, parallel-design, open label, study conducted in a real world
      clinical setting of post-MI patients will aim to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of
      vorapaxar in addition to antiplatelet therapy with a novel P2Y12 receptor inhibitor
      (prasugrel or ticagrelor) with and without aspirin.

      The main purpose of this study is to examine the effects of infliximab on measures related to
      depression symptoms. Infliximab is also known by its brand name Remicade. Infliximab, or
      Remicade, is given to by an intravenous (IV) needle and is currently used to treat rheumatoid
      arthritis and Crohn's disease. Infliximab is thought to help these conditions because it
      reduces inflammation in the body. Infliximab (Remicade) reduces inflammation by blocking a
      chemical in the body called tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. This chemical produces
      inflammation. Inflammatory chemicals in the body like TNF-alpha appear to be increased in
      some people with major depression. Researchers believe that a drug like infliximab, which
      blocks TNF-alpha, may be helpful in treating depression.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which participants will be randomized to
      receive one infusion of infliximab or placebo. The study will assess neuroimaging measures of
      corticostriatal circuitry before and after a placebo-controlled pharmacologic blockade of

      Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at increased risk of atherothrombotic events.
      Importantly, DM is a key risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD),
      which further enhances atherothrombotic risk. Clopidogrel is the most widely used platelet
      P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. However, despite its clinical benefit, patients with DM and CKD
      frequently experience recurrent atherothrombotic events. Ticagrelor is an oral, reversible,
      non-competitive P2Y12 receptor inhibitor with more potent and consistent platelet inhibition
      than clopidogrel. In large-scale clinical investigation, ticagrelor significantly reduced
      ischemic events to a greater extent than clopidogrel, a finding that was consistent also
      among DM patients. To date there has been no analysis on the efficacy of ticagrelor in DM
      patients according to CKD status. Moreover, although pharmacodynamic (PD) studies showed
      enhanced platelet inhibition associated with ticagrelor, it is unknown how this may be
      affected by CKD status. Ultimately, how PK/PD profiles of different ticagrelor dosing
      regimens may be affected by DM and CKD status is also unknown. The proposed study is aimed to
      show the impact of CKD status among patients with DM and coronary artery disease) CAD on PD
      and PK profiles of ticagrelor used at 2 doses (90mg bid and 60mg bid) in the setting of a
      prospective, randomized, cross-over trial.

      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), is considered the most effective treatment for severe
      treatment resistant major depressive disorder (MDD), but it requires about 3 weeks of
      treatments and can cause considerable acute deficits in memory. It would be a major advance
      in treatment if ECT could work faster with fewer treatments and result in decrease incidence
      of memory problems. Ketamine is an excellent candidate for augmentation of ECT because of its
      acute effects on depression, its short half-life, and its safety profile when given at low
      doses. Ketamine is given as an infusion and could easily be incorporated into the routine
      management of patients undergoing ECT, but has never been evaluated prospectively in this
      context.

      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains the gold-standard treatment for patients with
      depressive episodes. During a typical four-week ECT series, most depressive episodes will
      respond to treatment and people will improve their level of functioning (return to work or
      family). Independent of the antidepressant effect of ECT, many patients experience transient
      memory impairment. This investigation will examine the impact of one ECT parameter (pulse
      amplitude or current) on brain changes (structure of connections within the brain) and
      clinical outcomes. The goal of this investigation is to determine the optimal parameter for
      an individual patient that will maintain the clinical response (reduce depression severity)
      and minimize side effects (eliminate memory issues related to treatment).

      People with HIV have a high chance of becoming infected with TB, especially when they live in
      areas where TB infection is common. It can be difficult to diagnose TB in people who need to
      start HIV treatment right away. Within about 6 months after starting HIV treatment, some of
      these people can become very sick with TB and can even die from it.

      This study was being done in people who were starting HIV treatment and who lived in areas
      where the TB infection rate is high. The purpose of this study was to test an experimental
      approach to TB treatment to see if it is better than the usual approach. The experimental
      approach was to start TB treatment at the same time as HIV treatment, even when TB infection
      had not been found. The usual approach was to start TB treatment only if TB infection was
      found.

      In this study, half of the people started TB treatment at the same time as they started their
      HIV treatment. The other half started TB treatment only if TB infection was found.

      The study also tested how safe and effective it was to start TB treatment at about the same
      time as HIV treatment even when TB infection had not been found. The study collected
      information about diet, whether (and when) people in the study became sicker or died, how
      well their HIV was controlled, how they were feeling, how they were taking their medications,
      whether it mattered where they lived or what kind of HIV and TB care was standard, how many
      people were diagnosed with TB while in the study, and how the cost of the two treatment
      options on a national level could be compared.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate pain responses from two different approved medications
      (ketamine and fentanyl) in the treatment of pain after rattlesnake envenomation (RSE). Both
      medications are currently used in standard practice to treat both acute and chronic pain and
      are options for pain management after RSE. Multiple studies exist showing ketamine to be both
      safe and effective for the treatment of acute pain, and to be as good as or better than
      opioids for this indication. The specific comparison of ketamine to fentanyl, however, has
      never been studied for the treatment of acute pain after rattlesnake envenomation in the
      United States. The investigators plan to measure pain scores after a single dose of ketamine
      or fentanyl in patients shortly after being envenomated, followed by continued treatment of
      pain guided by the treating doctor. There will be no restrictions on additional pain
      medications given and no other changes to the treatment of these patients during their
      hospitalization. This research is important because pain after RSE can be difficult to
      control and may require frequent, high doses of opioids for several days. An effective
      non-opioid medication would be helpful both to better-control pain and to reduce exposure to
      opioids in this patient population. This study will compare patient-reported pain scores
      after receiving a single dose of ketamine or fentanyl in patients with rattlesnake bites who
      have been admitted to the toxicology service at Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix
      (BUMCP).

      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease where the blood pressure in the pulmonary
      arteries (PAP) is high. PAH increases the risk of adverse events, including death, during and
      or after procedures. The severity of baseline PAH correlates with the incidence of major
      complications, such that those with PAP higher than their systemic blood pressure (SBP) had a
      8 fold increased risk of complications. These children present for procedures where an acute
      exacerbation of their chronic illness-termed Pulmonary Hypertensive (PH)crisis, can occur,
      often resulting in death if not detected and managed expeditiously. Unfortunately there is
      little data and no consensus in the pediatric literature on how PH crisis should be managed.

      This study is a clinical trial designed to assess whether fish oil treatments are effective
      in the prevention of obesity-related fat tissue (adipose) inflammation. Specifically it
      addresses the hypothesis that fish oils treatments will reduce signaling by chemokine
      pathways (fractalkine and MCP-1) important in adipose tissue for the recruitment and
      activation of certain white blood cells (macrophages). The study is a double-blind

      and macrophage activation in adipose and blood and understand the mechanism by which fish

      After the age of 40, there is a gradual decline in the production of testosterone. Among
      obese men, the decline in testosterone levels is exacerbated by the suppression of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by hyperestrogenemia. The high expression of aromatase
      enzyme in the adipose tissue enhances the conversion of androgens into estrogens which in
      turn exert a negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, leading to the inhibition
      of production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH), and as a consequence, of testosterone by the testis resulting in
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Though bone loss is a well recognized side effect of AI
      in certain populations, such as women with breast cancer, HH obese men present high levels of
      circulating estrogens that could potentially prevent them from bone loss, estradiol being the
      main regulator of the male skeleton. This study is designed to determine if aromatase
      inhibitors in combination with weight loss, compared to weight loss alone, will have a
      positive effect on muscle strength, symptoms of hypogonadism, and body composition without
      negatively impacting bone mineral density and bone quality. Results from this study will help
      determine if certain groups of obese patients would benefit from therapy with aromatase
      inhibitors.

      This study will help provide information about how patients with burn handle two antibiotics
      (ceftolozane and tazobactam) and use that information to guide dosing recommendations for
      these patients. The 12 patients who complete the study will receive a single dose of 3 grams

      how much of each antibiotic is in the body and urine at various times over a 24 hour period.

      laboratories to perform simulations that will provide recommendations on optimal dosing

      Currently, aortic stenosis (AS) is considered a ""surgical disease"" with no medical therapy
      available to improve any clinical outcomes, including symptoms, time to surgery, or long-term
      survival. Thus far, randomized studies involving statins have not been promising with respect
      to slowing progressive valve stenosis. Beyond the valve, two common consequences of aortic
      stenosis are hypertrophic remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) and pulmonary venous
      hypertension; each of these has been associated with worse heart failure symptoms, increased
      operative mortality, and worse long-term outcomes. Whether altering LV structural
      abnormalities, improving LV function, and/or reducing pulmonary artery pressures with medical
      therapy would improve clinical outcomes in patients with AS has not been tested. Animal
      models of pressure overload have demonstrated that phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition
      influences nitric oxide (NO) - cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling in the LV and
      favorably impacts LV structure and function, but this has not been tested in humans with AS.
      Studies in humans with left-sided heart failure and pulmonary venous hypertension have shown
      that PDE5 inhibition improves functional capacity and quality of life, but patients with AS
      were not included in those studies. The investigators hypothesize that PDE5 inhibition with
      tadalafil will have a favorable impact on LV structure and function as well as pulmonary
      artery pressures. In this pilot study, the investigators anticipate that short-term
      administration of tadalafil to patients with AS will be safe and well-tolerated.

      Local anesthesia is an integral part of clinical pediatric dental practice, but it has
      challenges. It can be uncomfortable for children, and the risk of adverse events limits how
      much is used. Some evidence suggests benefits of buffering local anesthetics including equal
      effect with less pain on injection. These findings have not been replicated and validated
      among pediatric populations, creating a gap in the knowledge base. To address this knowledge
      gap and contribute to the evidence base on safety and efficacy of local anesthesia in
      pediatric dentistry, this investigation proposes to compare the anesthetic effects of
      buffered 1% lidocaine with those of unbuffered 2%, among children.

      The specific aims of this investigation are to determine differences between buffered 1% and
      unbuffered 2% lidocaine (both with 1:100,000 epinephrine) used for inferior alveolar nerve
      block (IAN) anesthesia, in the following domains:

        1. Pain experience on injection, time to onset following the administration, and time to
           recovery [subjective]

        2. Blood lidocaine levels 15 minutes following the administration and duration of pulpal
           anesthesia [objective]

      Null Hypotheses:

        1. No difference exists in anesthetic effectiveness for pulpal anesthesia after intraoral
           IAN block between buffered 1% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine as compared to
           unbuffered 2% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.

        2. No differences exist in peak blood lidocaine levels, pain on injection, time to lip
           numbness, and duration of anesthesia between the two drug formulations.

      Randomized subjects will be injected orally for bottom jaw anesthesia, with 3cc of buffered
      1% lidocaine (30mg) 1:100,000 epinephrine or 3cc unbuffered of 2% lidocaine (60mg) 1:100,000
      epinephrine. The injectable volume of the buffered formulation will include 0.3cc of 8.4%
      sodium bicarbonate.

      One faculty member in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at the University of North
      Carolina (UNC) School of Dentistry will administer the drugs in the Pediatric Dentistry
      clinic. The same clinician will administer injection to the same subjects at both visits.
      Clinicians and subjects will not know which drug formulation is given at which appointment.

      A clinician will measure the level of discomfort on injection, how long it takes for the lip
      to be numb, how long it takes for the first molar tooth in that area to be numb, how long it
      takes the local anesthetic to wear off, and how much of the anesthetic is in the blood.

      Serum concentrations of the different hormones involved in follicular steroid genesis during
      a cycle of controlled ovarian stimulation with recombinant FSH or HMG will be compared in
      this study. Serum Progesterone (P) levels at the end of Controlled Ovarian Stimulation (i.e.
      the day of triggering) have been related to cycle outcome, in terms of ongoing pregnancy and
      live birth rates. Large cohort studies show that P levels above a certain threshold are
      associated with poorer cycle outcome. The mechanisms behind P elevation are not well
      understood yet. It has been shown that P levels are positively related to ovarian response
      and to the dose of FSH given during COS. Furthermore, it has been well documented that P
      levels at the end of stimulation are significantly higher when recombinant (r) FSH is used
      for COS when compared to HMG, either in a GnRH agonist long protocol or in a GnRH antagonist
      protocol. Some authors suggest that this finding is explained by the fact that COS with rFSH
      provides a higher oocyte yield than when hMG is given, so the higher P levels observed would
      be explained by the larger number of follicles developed when rFSH is used. On the other
      hand, other authors explain this event by a different follicular esteroidogenesis when HMG is
      used for COS compared to rFSH The hypotheisis behind this assumption is that rFSH enhances P
      synthesis from its precursor pregnenolone in the granulosa cells. This P is unable to be
      further metabolized into androgens because of the lack of 17-20 lyase in the human granulosa
      cells, and therefore is delivered into circulation. On the other hand, when HMG is given for
      COS, the â4 pathway is promoted, and pregnenolone will be catabolized in to
      Dehidroepiandrostenodione (DHEA), in the theca cells, and this one to Androstenodione, which
      will be finally aromatized in to estrogens. This mechanism will explain the lower P and
      higher E2 levels observed in HMG cycles in comparison to rFSH cycles.

      causing the elevated serum thyroglobulin in persons with differentiated thyroid cancer who
      have elevated serum thyroglobulin levels and negative diagnostic imaging tests.

      This is for patients with:

           thyroglobulin antibodies ,

           scan (99mTc MDP), AND negative brain CT or magnetic resonance (MR) are performed, these
           are also negative.

      Voluntary patients will have sestamibi scan performed in 4 phases:

      Phase 1: receive an injection into their vein of a radioisotope called 99mTc sestamibi.

      Phase 2: wait for 60 to 90 minutes in a waiting room

      Phase 3: imaged lying face up on an imaging table while a camera passes around you from the
      top of the head to approximately the level of knees. This requires approximately 45 minutes

      Phase 4: images will be reviewed by the nuclear medicine physician. This will take ~10-15
      minutes. If additional images are required to clarify an image, then additional images of
      that area will be performed on the same camera or an alternate camera. As earlier, the
      additional images performed lying face up. These images require ~20-45 minutes. The patient
      will then be released.

      The risk of this study is considered very low, and the potential benefits to the patient are
      considered very high.

      This project will test the efficacy of fluoxetine to prevent serious consequences of COVID-19
      infection, especially death. Becoming sick with COVID-19 virus or any other serious
      respiratory condition is not fun. However, the dramatic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on
      human society stem from its significant mortality, not the number of individuals who become
      sick. This project aims to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization, respiratory
      failure and death during the time it takes to develop vaccinations and other strategies to
      prevent COVID-19 infectionPoor outcomes with COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization,
      respiratory failure, organ failure and death are associated with a dysfunctional exaggerated
      immune response, called a cytokine storm, that is triggered by Interleukin-6 expression
      (IL-6) and seems to occur around day 5 to 7 of symptoms. Fluoxetine has extraordinarily
      strong evidence in its action as a blocker of IL-6 and cytokine storms in both animal models
      of infection and in human illness such as rheumatoid arthritis and others. This action of
      fluoxetine is an entirely separate pathway than the serotonergic pathway that allows
      fluoxetine to act as an antidepressant. This pathway has been demonstrated in cell culture,
      in animal models, in human illness and by novel bioinformatics analyses of protein
      transcripts to be relatively unique for fluoxetine and appears to be a novel pathway. This
      project aims to inhibit the increase in IL-6 expression and thereby prevent the cytokine
      storm that causes poor outcomes. Patients who have tested positive or are presumptively
      positive for COVID-19 will be entered into the study and given the option to start the
      medication fluoxetine, which is demonstrated to prevent IL-6 surges in infectious and
      inflammatory conditions. Participants will be monitored daily for COVID-19 symptoms and
      weekly for side effects and tolerance of fluoxetine. A subset of patients will have blood
      drawn weekly and stored to monitor IL-6 and other cytokine levels at a later date.

      This project aims to reduce the serious outcomes of COVID-19 infection by preventing or
      inhibiting the cytokine storm associated with organ failure, respiratory failure and death.

      This pilot study aims to test a model that predicts that enhanced neurotransmitter
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function in reward and affect-regulation central nervous
      system (CNS) circuits mediates the antidepressant effects of exercise. State-of-the-art
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, cognitive assessment, accelerometry, genetic, and
      inflammatory biomarkers will be acquired through the coordination of efforts from several
      established research programs at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. This pilot study
      will be used as a platform for testing a causal/mediating role of GABA interneurons in reward
      processing and affect regulation in humans. This pilot study is not powered for testing a
      full causal model, but rather is intended to test overall feasibility of the intervention and
      acquisition of measures (see specific aim 1 below). This is a necessary prerequisite for
      designing a larger more definitive study of the model, which will be a component of a future
      grant application. Additionally, the data from this study will be used to test the clinical

      Converging evidence suggests that patients with bipolar disorder suffer from deficits in
      neurocognitive functioning that persist, despite remission of acute affective symptoms. These

      One of the most common hemostatic derangements in pediatric open- heart surgery is an acute
      acquired hypofibrinogenemia. This compromises fibrin clot generation and platelet
      aggregation, resulting in increased bleeding and allogenic blood transfusions.

      Currently, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate are used to supplement fibrinogen in
      pediatric cardiac patients. We propose that replacing cryoprecipitate with fibrinogen
      concentrate will be as effective in treating post-CPB bleeding and will decrease total blood
      product exposure when used as part of a blood transfusion algorithm.

      We plan to include all patients undergoing cardiac surgery on CPB less than 12 months and a
      fibrinogen level <250mg/dL while on bypass.

      We hope to demonstrate that fibrinogen concentrate is at least as effective as the standard
      of care in the management of peri- operative bleeding in neonatal patients undergoing
      cardiopulmonary bypass. If we are able to demonstrate that fibrinogen is at least as
      effective as the standard of care, then we would plan a multi-center trial to demonstrate the
      safety and efficacy of this medication. If we are able to demonstrate that fibrinogen
      concentrate is effective, fibrinogen concentrate could replace allogenic products and
      potentially decrease transfusion related morbidity in mortality in this population.

      Muscle relaxants are medications used during surgery to facilitate surgical access. The
      effect of the muscle relaxant medications is measured by stimulation a motor nerve and
      measuring the force of the resultant muscle contraction. Based on the mechanism of action,
      two kinds of muscle relaxants are described. First a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant and the
      second kind is the depolarizing muscle relaxant. These two kinds of muscle relaxants can be
      distinguished by rapidly stimulating the nerve 4 times over 2 seconds (Train of four or TOF).
      The nondepolarizing muscle relaxants produce fade ie successive muscle contractions are less
      forceful than the preceding ones. Whereas the depolarizing muscle relaxants are generally
      believed to produce four contractions of equal strength. However, there is some indication
      that this may not be entirely correct. There is evidence that depolarizing muscle relaxants
      also may produce fade. The investigators are conducting the following study to determine if
      indeed depolarizing muscle relaxants produce fade. The investigators would also like to
      characterize the fade ie differences during onset and offset of the block and the effect of
      the dose on the degree on the fade.

      Major depression is increasingly recognized to be a chronic and highly recurrent condition,
      which results in significantly increased health problems. One possible mechanism that may
      contribute to treatment resistance is increased production and release of chemicals called
      proinflammatory cytokines in patients with major depression. These chemicals mediate the
      body's response to infectious agents like bacteria and have been shown to be increased by
      psychological stress. They produce the symptoms that we associate with being sick, including
      fever, malaise and changes in sleep and appetite. Several lines of evidence indicate that
      proinflammatory cytokines may contribute to the development of major depression and may thus
      represent a novel target for the pharmacological treatment of the disorder.

      The TNF-alpha antagonist, Infliximab (RemicadeÂ®), is an infusion style drug approved by the
      FDA for the treatment of inflammatory conditions like Crohns disease and rheumatoid
      arthritis. The researchers are conducting a study to see if the infliximab (RemicadeÂ®) is
      more effective than placebo in acutely reducing symptoms of depression in patients who have
      elevated proinflammatory markers and have not responded to, or been unable to tolerate, at
      least two previous treatments in the current depressive episode. Proinflammatory markers are
      measured by a simple blood test for C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels in the body.

      After appropriate screening to determine eligibility, 64 subjects with treatment resistant
      depression will be randomized to receive three infusions of either infliximab (RemicadeÂ®) or
      placebo (salt water) in the Emory Infliximab Infusion Center in the Division of Digestive
      Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine. Subjects will be followed for 12 weeks with
      evaluations at weeks 0 (baseline), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. The first infliximab
      (RemicadeÂ®) infusion will occur at the first (Baseline) visit. The second infusion will occur
      at Study Week 2 (the third visit). The third infusion will occur at Study Week 6 (Visit 6).
      The choice of three infusions, and the infusion schedule, is based on current recommendations
      for the use of infliximab (RemicadeÂ®) in conditions for which it has received FDA approval.
      Subjects will be evaluated for twelve weeks by trained clinicians for changes in depression
      symptoms and improvements in quality of life. In addition, a physician will evaluate subjects
      each visit to make sure they are remaining healthy. Blood will be drawn at baseline prior to
      infusion and all subsequent visits to check labs for safety but also to evaluate potential
      relationships between changes in inflammatory activity and therapeutic response. After Study
      Week 12, participants will be monitored by phone, every 4 weeks during the 22-Week Post Study
      Follow-up Phase to assess physical and psychiatric symptoms in the period following the final
      infusion. At the baseline and Week 8 visits, subjects will be admitted to the Atlanta
      Clinical Translational Science Institute (ACTSI), a research unit in the Emory Hospital, for
      an extended evaluation. The purpose of coming to the ACTSI will be for researchers to
      evaluate whether treatment with infliximab improves endocrine function, inflammation, sleep
      and thinking abilities in people who are depressed. For all other visits (Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 10
      and 12), participants will come for an office visit in the Winship Cancer Institute.

      three visits for depressed patients and two for healthy controls (the first and third
      visits). The first visit will involve interviews and questionnaires to assess the
      participant's level of depression, medical history and quality of life. Participants will
      then complete the decision-making tasks, and will earn between $5-40 based on their choices,
      in order to make the decisions on the computer tasks financially meaningful. At the
      completion of this visit, depressed patients will be prescribed an FDA-approved
      antidepressant, chosen in consultation with the treating psychiatrist. Patients will be

      Adenotonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in the pediatric
      population in the United States. It is generally a well-tolerated procedure with
      post-operative bleeding risk ranging from 3-5% in children. Post-operative pain following
      adenotonsillectomy has significant morbidity and may result in prolonged hospital stay or
      re-admission to the hospital. Post-operative analgesia is most commonly managed with
      narcotic-containing pain medication. In recent years however, there is evidence that some
      patients may manifest increased sensitivity to narcotics, resulting in life-threatening
      respiratory compromise. Though there is a theoretical risk that nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase bleeding time by disrupting platelet aggregation,
      evidence of detrimental effects (i.e. increased risk of postoperative bleeding) remains
      inconclusive for these generally well-tolerated medications. The goal of this study is to
      determine the incidence of post-operative bleeding and to determine the efficacy of NSAIDs in
      the management of post-operative pain following pediatric adenotonsillectomy, versus more
      commonly used narcotic pain medication. The study design will be an initial retrospective
      study to collect pilot data on the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage and indicators of
      adequate/inadequate pain control in children age 4 to 17 undergoing adenotonsillectomy. This
      will be followed by a prospective, randomized, single-blind controlled study in which
      orally-administered ibuprofen (test intervention) is compared to acetaminophen-hydrocodone
      (control intervention) in the postoperative period following adenotonsillectomy.

      This study was done with people who were infected with HIV, but did not show any signs of
      having HIV. They were also feeling well without taking HIV medication and had low or
      undetectable levels of the virus in the blood. The purpose of this study was to see if taking
      HIV medication (antiretroviral therapy [ART]) would reduce immune activation (a signal that
      the body is fighting an infection) in people who have HIV, but did not show symptoms. Also
      this study helped determine how safe the drug was and how well people reacted to the drug.

      For this study, the following antiretroviral therapy (ART) was be provided in the form of a
      single tablet that contains three different drugs: emtricitabine/rilpivirine/tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (FTC/RPV/TDF). These drugs were combined as one tablet which was approved
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a single pill to treat HIV infection. The HIV
      medication provided was one of the recommended treatments for HIV, including people with low
      viral loads (how much HIV you have in your body) who were taking HIV drugs for the first
      time. The risks seen with this HIV medication were the same that one would encounter when
      taking these drugs outside of the study.

      Cesarean delivery under general anesthesia is one of few only surgical procedures, where the
      most important factor of safety is the speed of the surgery, as a newborn adaptation strongly
      depends on a time between induction to the general anesthesia (and administration of
      anesthetics) and pennywort ligation. The shortest possible interval is essential for the
      amount of anesthetics crossing placenta into the fetal circulation.

      The primary objective:

      To compare surgical conditions for fetus delivery in Cesarean section under general
      anesthesia with deep neuromuscular blockade versus standard procedure with succinylcholine.

      The primary safety objective:

      To compare influence of different levels of neuromuscular blockade and surgical conditions on
      newborn adaptation after the Cesarean delivery.

      The secondary objectives:

      To compare influence of deep versus no/shallow muscle blockade during the entire Cesarean
      section on surgical conditions for suture of the uterus and the abdominal wall with attention
      to blood loss, time of surgery and surgical complications.

      To describe pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of deep neuromuscular blockade by
      rocuronium over the course of Cesarean section and its reversal by sugammadex at the end of
      procedure.

      Clinical hypotheses:

      The use of deep muscle blockade in Cesarean section under general anesthesia, including the
      period of fetus delivery, compare to the standard recommended practice with succinylcholine,
      will improve the surgical conditions and allow faster and easier delivery of the fetus with
      positive effect on its postnatal adaptation. Faster delivery will reduce an incision to
      delivery interval with decrease of time between anesthetics administration and delivery. This
      will reduce the amount of anesthetics crossing the placenta to the fetal circulation. Both,
      reduced amount of anesthetics and reduced incision to delivery interval itself will improve a
      newborn adaptation after Cesarean delivery.

      Deep neuromuscular blockade will also improve surgical conditions for the whole surgery, when
      no or shallow only neuromuscular blockade is routinely used. We assume that deep
      neuromuscular blockade during the entire surgery will create better surgical conditions for
      faster and easier uterus suture and the rest of surgery and thus reduce perioperative blood
      loss and incidence of surgical complications.

      Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs are the mainstay of therapy for diabetic
      macular edema (DME), substantially improving visual acuity for many diabetics worldwide, and
      proving effective for treatment of both non-proliferative and proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy.

      Many studies such as Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network studies, RESTORE Study,
      and The BOLT Study have supported the use of different anti-VEGF agents in the treatment of
      DME with better visual outcomes using anti-VEGF injections alone or in combination with other
      treatments.

      Several ocular complications of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections have been reported
      including endophthalmitis, cataract and retinal detachment. The effect of anti-VEGF drugs on
      macular perfusion has been inconclusive, with mixed reports of increase, decrease or no
      effect on perfusion in response to anti-VEGF treatment. In many of these studies, however,
      patients with more ischaemic retinas were not included. Retinal ischemia is an important
      factor in the progression and prognosis of diabetic retinopathy.

      Fluorescein angiography (FA) was the method used to assess changes in macular perfusion after
      anti-VEGF injections in most of the studies. Despite its clinical usefulness, however, FA is
      known to have documented risks. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new
      noninvasive method of acquiring high-resolution images of the retinal vasculature that can be
      utilized in the treatment of retinal disease without the need for dye injection. It allows
      the visualization of the superficial and deep retinal capillary layers separately and the
      construction of microvascular flow maps.

      Several studies have proved the reliability of OCTA in detecting and quantifying macular
      ischemia in diabetics.

      In this study, investigators aim to evaluate the effect of repeated intravitreal injections
      of different Anti-VEGF agents on the perfusion of different capillary layers in the macula of
      diabetic patients using OCTA.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the functional outcomes of patients with shoulder
      pathology treated with either ketorolac or corticosteroid injections, in a randomized
      double-blinded study. Investigators will compare the effectiveness of ketorolac compared to
      corticosteroid.

      Specific Aim 1:

      Hypothesis 1: Injection of the shoulder (in the subacromial space) with Ketorolac will be
      more effective than corticosteroid injection for the treatment of a variety of shoulder
      pathologies.

      The risks associated with this study primarily concern adverse reactions to the study drugs.
      The drugs used in this study are not narcotics or habit-forming but can have side effects.
      The patient's physician will screen for any heart, intestinal, or kidney disease or condition
      that would increase the chance for the patient to have an unwanted side effect.

      PURPOSE The purpose of this case series is to clinically, radiographically and histologically
      evaluate the treatment of dehiscence defects in extraction sockets using a minimally-invasive
      GBR technique that involves the application of a particulate bone allograft and a
      non-resorbable PTFE membrane.

      METHODS Subjects with single-rooted teeth indicated for extraction and interested in future
      implant therapy for tooth replacement will be recruited on the basis of an eligibility
      criteria. A buccal or lingual dehiscence defect must strongly be suspected or confirmed upon
      clinical examination in order for the subject to qualify for study inclusion. A cone-beam
      computer tomography (CBCT) scan of the arch containing the tooth to be extracted will be
      obtained prior to tooth extraction. Following minimally invasive tooth extraction and
      debridement, the socket will be evaluated to verify the presence of a dehiscence defect
      affecting at least 50% of the bony plate height. After creating a soft tissue 'pouch' using
      tunneling instruments, a non-absorbable dense-PTFE (dPTFE) barrier membrane that will be
      trimmed to a size and shape that would allow for complete extension over the existing defect
      will be tucked between the mucosa and the alveolar bone. Then, the extraction socket will be
      grafted with particulate allograft and the access to the socket will be sealed with an
      extension of the membrane and an external cross mattress suture. Subjects will be recalled at
      1, 2 and 5 weeks to monitor healing and assess the level of discomfort using a visual analog
      scale at the end of each visit. At the 5-week visit, the membrane will be gently removed and
      the exposed area will be left to heal by secondary intention. At 20 weeks after tooth
      extraction a second CBCT will be obtained to radiographically evaluate the site for implant
      placement. Bone volumetric reconstructions of the alveolar ridge at baseline and at 20 weeks
      will be made using the CBCT data to assess changes affecting the bone housing. If the site
      has healed adequately, implant placement will be planned at 24 weeks after tooth extraction.
      A bone core biopsy will be obtained at the time of implant placement in order to
      histologically analyze the characteristics of the grafted substrate. Upon implant placement
      with primary stability a healing abutment will be placed and sutures will be given to achieve
      primary wound closure, as necessary. Subjects will return for the final study visit at 2
      weeks following implant placement to evaluate the healing prior to being referred back to the
      restorative dentist.

      using intravascular imaging and gene expression analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMC) in patients with stable CAD on maximally tolerated statin therapy. The study
      combines multi-modality intravascular imaging approaches and transcriptomic based machine
      learning algorithms to uncover molecular mechanisms responsible for the beneficial changes in
      atherosclerotic lesions of patients treated with evolocumab. The primary end-points are the
      changes from baseline to follow-up in (1) the minimal fibrous cap thickness (FCT) assessed by
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) and (2) maxLCBI4mm assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS) after 26 weeks of evolocumab. The secondary endpoints are the changes in (1) the
      maximal lipid arc, lipid length, lipid volume index, macrophage accumulation and
      calcification by OCT; (2) PAV and TAV defined by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and (3)
      Changes in PBMC gene expression.

      Obese pregnant women (BMI â¥ 30 kg/m2) are more likely than their normal-weight counterparts
      to require induction of labor because of increased rates of obstetric complications including
      pregnancy related hypertensive disorders, diabetes, and prolonged gestations. Several studies
      have shown that obese women experience increased labor duration and oxytocin needs when
      compared to normal-weight women. This in turn results in increased rates for unplanned
      cesarean delivery (CD) as a result of failed induction of labor (IOL), arrest disorders and

      The specific aim of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial is to determine if
      extended release nitrofurantoin antibiotic prophylaxis decreases the incidence of symptomatic
      urinary tract infection (UTI) compared with placebo for patients undergoing short term
      indwelling or clean intermittent self-catheterization (CISC) for acute postoperative urinary
      retention following pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence surgery.

      Consented patients who undergo urogenital surgery and fail their post-operative voiding trial
      will be randomized to either extended release nitrofurantoin 100mg or an identical appearing
      placebo capsule to be taken daily while performing CISC or while indwelling catheter is in
      place. The primary outcome will be symptomatic and culture confirmed UTI within six weeks of
      surgery. Secondary outcomes include adverse events associated with nitrofurantoin use, and
      incidence of nitrofurantoin-resistant isolates from urine culture of symptomatic women.

      Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated with Student t test and chi squared or
      Fisher exact test as appropriate. Assuming a decrease in symptomatic UTIs attributable to
      nitrofurantoin prophylaxis from 33% to 13%, with 80% power, and a two-sided alpha of 0.05,
      and a 10% dropout rate, we should recruit a total of 154 patients.

      Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common dermatologic diseases affecting infants and
      children. The incidence is highest among those 9-12 months old and it has been reported to
      affect 7-50% of infants in the US. It is caused by skin exposure to a combination of several
      factors including: excessive moisture, topical irritants, reduced pH, friction, maceration
      and bacterial infection. When infants soil their diaper, diaper contents saturate the area
      raising the pH of the skin above the normal level of 5 or less, and leaving the area highly
      vulnerable to maceration from friction. Irritants in urine and feces are then able to
      penetrate the macerated skin, causing inflammation and greater skin friability. An elevation
      in the skin pH allows pathogenic bacteria to overgrow, and combined with the breakdown in the
      skin's outer epithelial barrier, can lead to bacterial infection. Theraworx Foam
      Formulation-Allantoin Liquid by Avadim Technologies, Inc. is a skin protectant with use for
      temporary protection of minor cuts, scrapes, burns and chapped or cracked skin. As such,
      Theraworx Foam used in the diaper area may be beneficial for protecting skin against diaper
      rash wounds, as well as for assisting with wound healing and reducing any associated pain.
      The purpose of this study is to determine caregivers' perceptions of the benefits of using
      Theraworx Foam on their infant's diaper area as part of their hygienic routine, including
      whether they feel the product is pleasant and easy to use, and whether they feel it helps
      prevent and reduce the severity of diaper dermatitis in their infants 1-14 months old.

      The hypothesis for this study is whether a treatment regimen containing Atazanavir in

      Good sugar control in postoperative hospitalized patient has been shown to improve wound
      healing and infection rates. However, sugar control is difficult to achieve and suboptimal
      use of insulin is thought to be a contributory factor. Though it is known that generally the
      consumption of carbohydrates alone raises the blood sugar, the usual practice of dosing
      meal-time insulin is based on the fraction of the total meal-tray eaten which includes
      proteins, fats and carbohydrates. This leads to an overestimation of insulin required for a
      patient who consumes a portion of mainly proteins and fats on their trays or an
      underestimation for those eating mainly the carbohydrates on their tray. Low sugars or high
      blood sugars can follow respectively.

      Hypothesis: The purpose of this study is to see if dosing meal-time insulin based on grams of
      carbohydrates consumed will result in better sugar control compared to the usual practice of
      dosing meal-time insulin based on percent of total meal consumed in hospitalized patients.

      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common in patients receiving hemodialysis. The uptake of
      antiviral therapy for these patients is limited in the era of interferon (IFN) plus ribavirin
      (RBV), probably because the sustained virologic response (SVR) rates are low and the risk of
      treatment-related adverse events (AEs) are high. In the era of IFN-free direct acting
      antiviral agents (DAAs), several studies have indicated high rates of SVR and excellent
      safety profiles to treat patients with severe renal impairment. With regard to
      elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) treatment, a phase 3 study (C-SURFER) study has shown 99% of
      SVR in HCV-1 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 or 5. Furthermore, most
      patients tolerated the treatment well. Although the data confirmed the excellent safety and
      efficacy in HCV-1 patients with severe renal impairment, data regarding the safety and
      efficacy for Asian HCV-1b patients receiving hemodialysis is lacking. Therefore, we aim to
      evaluated the safety and efficacy of EBR/GZR for 12 weeks in treatment-naive and

      Breast reduction mammoplasty (BRM) is among the most commonly performed procedures in plastic
      surgery. However, postoperative hematoma is one of the most common complications following
      BRM. Hematoma-related complications include unplanned surgery, need for blood transfusion,
      wound healing issues, and unfavorable surgical outcomes.

      Tranexamic acid has emerged in the literature as a promising agent that reduces perioperative
      blood loss and need for transfusion. However, despite its consistently reported efficacy, low
      cost, and favorable safety profile, tranexamic acid remains underutilized in plastic surgery.

      The investigators propose a prospective, double-blinded randomized controlled study of the
      efficacy of tranexamic acid in reducing hematoma development in patients undergoing reduction
      mammoplasty. The investigators hope to contribute to the growing body of literature
      supporting tranexamic acid to reduce unwanted surgical bleeding.

      The purpose of this study is to try to find out how critically ill patients receiving the
      anti fungal medication, posaconazole, process it in their body. Investigators would like to
      study if the recommended doses of posaconazole achieve adequate concentrations in the
      patients blood to treat fungal infections.The disease process in critically ill patients can
      profoundly influence the concentration of anti fungal medication in the blood. The process by
      which a drug travels through the body in blood, how it is broken down and removed by the body
      is called pharmacokinetics (PK).

      This information is important to know because if antifungal levels are low in the blood, the
      fungal infection has an opportunity to become resistant to the antifungal medication which
      can lead to the medication being less effective against the fungal infection potentially
      exposing future patients with infection to a limited range of effective antifungals.

      Investigators can measure the PK by taking blood samples at specific times after the anti
      fungal medication is given.

      This study will enroll 8 patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit and are being
      treated with an antifungal medication for a fungal infection. Patients will be consented and
      given a single dose of posaconazole and serial blood samples will be collected just prior to
      the dose and at 15, 45,75 minutes during the infusion and at 3, 5, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30 36 and

      Saphenous vein graft disease remains an unresolved medical problem. Many vein grafts occlude
      in the first year after bypass surgery, leading to adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including
      recurrent angina, myocardial infarction, and the need for repeat coronary intervention. While
      aspirin is the standard antiplatelet treatment after CABG surgery, 10-20% of vein grafts
      continue to occlude despite contemporary secondary preventative therapy. Compared to aspirin
      and other antiplatelet therapies like clopidogrel, ticagrelor treatment leads to a more
      pronounced platelet inhibition, and may substantially improve graft patency following CABG
      compared to aspirin. No data has yet to be collected regarding the impact of ticagrelor on
      saphenous vein graft patency following CABG. In this context, the investigators seek to
      compare vein graft patency between patients randomized to receive aspirin therapy, the

      Continuous paravertebral analgesia and erector spinae plane blockade (ESP) are accepted
      techniques at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) for the management of thoracic

      nerve blocks are being performed as it has been demonstrated in our institution, and via case
      reports that the blocks provide clinical effectiveness, but may have a better side-effect
      profile than the paravertebral nerve block. However, the relative efficacy of ESP compared to
      paravertebral nerve block remains to be established for video assisted thoracoscopic surgery
      (VATS). This is a prospective randomized study intended to assess the efficacy, safety and
      side-effect profile of continuous erector spinae plane analgesia versus continuous
      paravertebral analgesia for VATS procedures. It will include 60 patients presenting to UPMC
      Passavant for a VATS procedure. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a nerve
      block via continuous paravertebral infusion or via erector spinae plane infusion. In
      addition, to treat breakthrough pain, the patients in both arms will receive multimodal
      adjunctive therapy per routine. Bupivacaine and ropivacaine are FDA approved for use in nerve
      block catheters. The primary outcome will be to compare analgesic efficacy between the two
      nerve blocks as defined by total opioid consumption and pain scores on the numeric pain

      score postoperatively), length of stay, duration of catheter and report of adverse events or

      Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the third most common health condition affecting older
      adults after heart disease and arthritis and is the fifth leading cause of years lived with
      disability worldwide. Many hearing-impaired older adults avoid or withdraw from social
      contexts in which background noise will make it difficult to communicate, resulting in social
      isolation and reduced communication with family and friends.Social isolation and loneliness
      have been linked to numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including dementia,
      depression, and mortality, and they may also lead to declining physical activity and the
      development of the syndrome of frailty. In this project it is hypothesized that untreated
      ARHL represents a distinct route to developing Late-life Depression (LLD) and that
      individuals with comorbid ARHL/LLD are unlikely to respond to treatments (i.e.,
      antidepressant medication) that do not treat the underlying hearing problem. Initial studies
      suggest remediation of hearing loss using hearing aids or cochlear implantation may decrease
      depressive symptoms acutely and over the course of 6 to 12 months follow-up. However, the
      clinical significance of these findings is obscured by lack of rigorous control groups,
      failure to objectively document hearing aid compliance, and enrollment of study populations
      lacking syndromal depression or even a threshold symptom score.

      Urge urinary incontinence (UUI) is a socially debilitating disease due to its inherently
      unpredictable nature and sometimes large volumes of urine loss. Women with UUI may experience
      anxiety over public episodes of incontinence and concerns about odor and, as a result,
      isolate themselves socially. This isolation affects both partners in the relationship and may
      be a source of discord. The impact of UUI also moves into personal relationships where fears
      or actual episodes of incontinence during physical intimacy, including but limited to
      intercourse, may result in limited interactions and changes in the relationship satisfaction
      for both partners. Few studies have examined the role of urinary incontinence, particularly
      UUI, in the dynamics of an intimate partner relationship and none have evaluated the impact
      of successful UUI treatment.

      The long-term goal of our research is to understand the social and emotional impact of pelvic
      floor disorders, particularly UUI, on the well-being of an intimate relationship. Ultimately,
      we aim to evaluate the role that successful treatment plays in the alleviation of discord in
      intimate partner relationships that are affected by UUI and other pelvic floor disorders.

      Our objective for this proposal is to characterize, using validated, quantifiable methods the
      quality of the relationship in couples affected by UUI and to identify the role that
      treatment plays in improving this relationship. Our central hypothesis is that UUI has a
      negative impact upon the emotional and physical well-being of a relationship and that
      effective treatment will result in improvement in areas of the relationship that have been
      detrimentally affected by UUI. Our rationale for this study is that an understanding of UUI
      in the context of a couple, particularly from the perspective of the male partner, will
      improve our ability to holistically treat UUI, thus improving patient outcomes and
      satisfaction.

      Gout is the most common cause of inflamed joints affecting 1.4% of adults in the UK. Most
      patients are treated entirely in general practice yet primary care management is frequently
      suboptimal. Acute attacks of gout are excruciatingly painful and require urgent drug
      treatment to reduce inflammation, most commonly with antiinflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) or
      colchicine. In primary care, NSAIDs are most commonly used but can cause serious side effects
      such as stomach ulcers and heart disease, particularly in the elderly. Patients frequently
      require repeat prescriptions for recurrent attacks of acute gout increasing the risk of
      drug-related side-effects. Low-dose colchicine is popular amongst rheumatologists as it is
      effective and well tolerated. However, general practitioners (GPs) prescribe colchicine
      infrequently, probably because in the past the recommendation was for high doses to be
      prescribed which commonly caused severe diarrhoea. Recently, prescribing recommendations for
      colchicine have changed, advocating a lower dose regime.

      Currently there is no evidence regarding whether NSAIDs or low-dose colchicine is the best
      treatment for acute gout. This trial will be the first direct comparison of the effectiveness
      and side effects of a NSAID (naproxen) and low-dose colchicine to treat acute gout in primary
      care. Naproxen will be used in this trial because it has been shown to be as effective as
      oral prednisolone for the treatment of acute gout, is safer than other commonly used NSAIDs
      such as diclofenac and indomethacin, and is inexpensive.

      Patients consulting their GP with an acute attack of gout in up to 100 general practices will
      be invited to participate. Treatment success will be assessed by comparing pain reduction
      between the two drugs. The trial will also monitor side effects, quality of life, and cost
      effectiveness.

      In some patients, levothyroxine liquid gel capsules may demonstrate superior absorption than
      the tablet option. Impaired absorption of thyroid hormone directly correlates to higher and

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patient satisfaction after eye surgery when given a
      capsule compared to an intravenous (IV) dose of sedation (calming medication).

      Each subject will be given a capsule and an IV in the hospital before their procedure starts,
      however they will not know which one is the sedation route. Each subject will have their
      planned surgical procedure as previously discussed with their doctor. After the procedure is
      completed, the doctors will complete satisfaction surveys. The subject will also complete a
      satisfaction survey during their regularly scheduled visit the day after surgery. Once the
      subject completes this survey, their study participation will be complete.

      The hypothesis is that there will be no difference in patient satisfaction when given a
      capsule in comparison to IV sedation. If the results of the study support this hypothesis, a
      capsule could be used in place of IV sedation. By using a capsule for ocular procedures, both
      patients and the medical practice would benefit: patient would be able to eat before their
      procedure, patient costs would be decreased, hospital costs would be reduced, and some of
      these procedures would be given the option to move to a procedure room (freeing up operating
      room time for other departments).

      Background:

      - Treatment for Hepatitis C has changed a lot in the past 2 years. Most of this change comes
      from a combination of medicines that is yielding high cure rates. But its long-term effects
      are uncertain. One problem is that a lot of people need the treatment, but only a few
      specialists can give it. The success rate for Hepatitis C treatment by primary care doctors,
      nurse practitioners, or physician assistants is largely unknown. Researchers want to see how
      provider type affects treatment outcomes. They will conduct a large, community-based study in
      the District of Columbia.

      Objectives:

      - To see if people can be treated for Hepatitis C safely and successfully in community-based
      health centers.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults who need treatment for chronic Hepatitis C infection.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with blood tests. Their current medicines will be
           reviewed.

        -  Participants will give researchers access to their medical records. Researchers will
           follow participants through these records.

        -  Participants will see a primary care or infectious disease provider. The provider will
           tell them about their treatment. They will be told how often they will visit the
           provider and how often they will have their blood drawn. They will get a calendar of
           study visits.

        -  Participants will take Harvoni for 8, 12, or 24 weeks. They will visit their care
           provider monthly.

        -  Participants will have monthly follow-up visits for up to 3 months after they finish
           their medicine.

        -  Participants will have yearly follow-up visits with their care provider for up to 10
           years.

      During many surgeries, increased muscle tension makes it harder for the surgeon to expose the
      site of surgery and work within the incision. Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) drugs such as
      Vecuronium bind to neurotransmitter (acetyl choline) receptors at the neuromuscular junction,
      blocking their action and producing muscle relaxation. This muscle relaxation allows easier
      retraction of muscle tissues and manipulation of structures in the wound. Improved surgical
      conditions are likely to result in improved patient outcomes. While increased depths of NMB
      have been shown to optimize surgical conditions during intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal
      procedures, the impact of NMB depth has not been reported for orthopedic surgeries.1 To
      address this, we propose to study the effect of NMB depth on surgical conditions during total
      hip replacement (THR).

      Statins are a class of drugs that are highly effective at lowering cholesterol levels.
      However, compliance is often limited by symptoms of muscle pain. The investigators would like
      to study Vitamin-D deficient individuals who also have muscle pain due to statin use. About 1
      billion people are estimated to have low or insufficient levels of vitamin D worldwide.

      Pharmacogenetics is an area of Pharmacology that studies the contribution of genetic factors
      to individual responses to drugs. This branch of science involves the variability in
      pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics through the study of polymorphisms in genes encoding
      receptors, as well as in drug metabolism, where this area of Pharmacology has been growing
      and achieving its first results with clinical use. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      (NSAIDS) are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) family, predominantly CYP2C9. The goal of
      this study is to evaluate the different gene haplotypes for the clinical efficacy of
      piroxicam after third lower molar surgery for pain, edema and trismus, adverse reactions,
      need of rescue medication, patient satisfaction regarding the drug and the pharmacokinetics
      of the drug between the different gene haplotypes for CYP2C9 that are found in this
      population. Therefore, 60 patients will be genotyped and phenotyped for this gene and their
      postoperative data will be confronted with the data found in the Brazilian population. For
      the analysis of the proposed gene, saliva will be collected and serve as a source of genomic
      DNA. For the molecular analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with tests validated and
      produced by Applied BiosystemsÂ® will be performed. For the pharmacokinetics, saliva samples
      will be collected at various times according to protocols available in the literature, and
      piroxicam concentrations in the samples will be measured by high pressure liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS). The analysis of
      the results will be described with a significance level of 0.05.

      Despite the increasing use of patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) for postoperative pain
      management, efforts are continuing to find effective methods to relieve pain after abdominal
      surgery. Although opioid is an effective analgesic it has opioid related adverse events
      (ORAEs). Bupivacaine should reduce postoperative pain but it has relatively shorter duration
      of action. Liposome bupivacaine (Exparel) has been approved as a single dose infiltration for
      longer postoperative period analgesic. It provides up to 72 hours analgesia postoperatively;
      results in lesser opioids usage and reduce the ORAEs. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block
      is a relatively new regional anesthetic technique. TAP blocks have been performed to reduce
      opioid use and control pain in several laparoscopic surgical procedures, including colorectal
      resections, cholecystectomy and bariatric surgery. The aim of this study is to study the
      opiate usage, pain and nausea post laparoscopic gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy using
      Exparel versus Bupivacaine as TAP block and port sites infiltration.

      Opioid use and abuse has become a major medical problem in the United States. Over
      prescription of opioid medications is a major contributor to this growing problem. Cesarean
      delivery (CD) is the most commonly performed surgery in the US and women are generally given
      opioid medications for postoperative pain management. This is not a common practice in other
      developed countries. We believe that a multimodal pain management strategy is superior to
      current practices for control of postoperative pain after CD and will lead to a decrease in
      the use of opioid medications. This will have beneficial effects on patients' recovery and
      bonding with their newborns, as well as societal effects in reducing the burden of opioid
      abuse in the US. Our objective is to investigate the use of a multimodal pain regimen in
      pregnant patients undergoing CD. This is a randomized double-blinded, placebo controlled
      trial. The multimodal intervention consists of a pre-operative dose of IV acetaminophen
      (Ofirmev), infiltration of subcutaneous bupivacaine prior to skin incision, and a dose of IM
      ketorolac at time of fascial closure. These study medications are currently used in our
      patient population but not in a standardized fashion, not in every patient, and not always in
      combination with each other. The control group will receive placebo IV infusion
      preoperatively and an IM injection at fascial closure, and subcutaneous infiltration with
      normal saline before skin incision. Both groups will receive spinal regional anesthesia as
      per anesthesia team and then postoperatively, both groups will receive the current standard
      of care, which consists postoperative hydrocodone/acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed
      depending on pain score. Our primary outcome of interest will be the total opioid intake in
      the first 48 hours after surgery. Secondary outcomes include time to first opioid given, pain
      scores at 6-12, 24 and 48 hours post op, and total number of opioid tablets left after
      discharge on post op day number 7. We will also evaluate patient satisfaction scores and
      total length of hospital stay. We will evaluate neonatal outcomes including Apgar scores,
      cord blood gases, immediate newborn complications in the first 48 hours after birth, and any
      infant adverse outcomes related to maternal opioid use up to 4 weeks of life. Our hypothesis
      is that our multimodal pain regimen will decrease the total opioid requirement in the first
      48 hours after surgery.

      There are many recent advances in insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes, however after a meal
      sugars are always a concern. There is a drug Exenatide (Byetta) which is FDA approved to
      treat people with type 2 diabetes which helps correct their glucoses (sugars) after meals.
      This study is going to test whether this drug can improve the after meal sugars in people
      with new onset type 1 diabetes. To test this you will be given a dose of exenatide (1.25 mcg)
      and long acting insulin or inulin alone before the boost. There is also a placebo group
      (healthy subjects) who do not get any medication before the boost. Insulin levels and other
      hormones that affect blood glucose as well as your sugar will be measured by a series of
      blood tests. The role exenatide as compared to insulin alone will be examined to prevent low
      blood sugars which might occur because of food staying longer in the stomach than usual or
      due to the suppression of a hormone called glucagon which increases blood sugar. If you

      A multimodal analgesic regimen including regional anesthesia is used at UPMC Shadyside for
      primary thoracic and major abdominal surgeries. The current standard-of-care regional
      anesthesia techniques include Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) block for video assisted thorascopic
      surgery (VATS) and Quadratus Lumborum (QL) block for major abdominal surgery. These blocks
      are routinely administered as a continuous catheter technique in order to extend the duration
      of postoperative analgesia. Although rare, continuous nerve block techniques carry risks and
      limitations, including catheter dislodgement, migration, kinking and leaking at the site,
      bleeding, and infection. They are also much more expensive to perform and maintain than
      single-injection nerve blocks at this institution. Perioperative intravenous (IV) lidocaine
      is one of the safest local anesthetics, and its use has been shown to provide analgesia and
      reduce opioid requirements. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that part of the analgesic
      efficacy of continuous peripheral nerve blocks may be due to the systemic effects of the
      local anesthetic infused at the site. Therefore, it is possible that the combination of a
      single block followed by an infusion of IV lidocaine may provide the same benefits as a
      continuous nerve block at a lower cost. The purpose of this study is to show that a single
      block technique plus IV lidocaine is non-inferior to a continuous block technique. For the
      purpose of this study we chose two surgical models--VATS and major abdominal surgery--and ESP
      and QL blocks, respectively. The study will be conducted as a prospective, randomized (1:1),
      open-label, active-comparator, noninferiority trial. The study will prospectively investigate
      the efficacy of continuous block versus single block plus IV lidocaine infusion for

      The literature regarding analgesic modalities, their combinations and routes of
      administrations for patients with pain related to renal colic is expanding. NSAID's (IV
      ketorolac) and opioids (morphine) constitutes the mainstay of treatment of renal colic either
      alone or in combinations. Despite their synergism and analgesic superiority when administered
      together, both classes of these medications possess a set of unfavorable side effects that
      limit their use. Emerging data of the use of IV lidocaine for patients with renal colic
      demonstrated good analgesic efficacy and safety profile. However, none of the trials directly
      compared lidocaine to ketorolac or the combination of both as viable options in patients
      unable to tolerate or to have serious contraindications to opioids. We designed a
      double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate analgesic efficacy, safety and
      feasibility of non-opioid analgesics and their combinations in patients with renal colic. The
      hypothesis and proposed study will try to determine if a combination of IV lidocaine and
      reduced dose of IV ketorolac is superior to either drug alone and if this non-opioid
      analgesic modality is effective for controlling pain of renal colic origin.

      The current standard of catecholamine vasopressor management of perioperative hypotension in
      kidney transplant patients carries significant risks and falls short in many ways. Currently,
      there is an absence in the scientific literature and research describing the hemodynamic
      effectiveness and safety of novel pharmacologic agents such as angiotensin II (Giapreza - Ang
      II) in perioperative kidney transplant patients. Phase 3 registration trials have
      demonstrated the superior safety and efficacy of Ang II (Giapreza) in distributive shock
      patients compared to traditional vasopressor agents and the novel mechanism of action may

      kidney transplant recipients. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and hemodynamic

          -  Planned surgery/procedure: The goal is to enroll patients who will not have pain when
             they awake from anesthesia. We will include patients who are having magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) under anesthesia, or an eye exam under anesthesia. We will also include
             those patients who are having a surgery in which a regional or caudal block is part of
             the planned anesthetic. This will be small orthopedic procedures in the lower
             extremities; or urologic or general surgical procedures below the level of the
             umbilicus. These patients have been chosen because the regional/caudal block should
             result in the patient not having pain when they awake from anesthesia.

        (The caudal block is a single epidural injection of local anesthetic that is done when the
        pediatric patient is under general anesthesia. It is a routine procedure that results in
        numbness below the level of the umbilicus, and gives relief of pain, for about 8 hours.)

             environment, make eye contact, have purposeful actions, or be aware of their
             surroundings even when at their baseline pre-operatively. It would be difficult to

      Truvada (Emtricitabine or FTC and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or TDF) has been approved for
      HIV prevention since 2012. Drug concentrations after receipt of oral Truvada for HIV Pre
      Exposure Prophylaxis (or PrEP) appeared to be lower in transgender women compared to Men who
      Have Sex with Men (MSM) in the iPrEx study, the landmark study of PrEP for HIV prevention.
      Concentrations were especially low among transgender women (TGW) reporting use of feminizing
      hormones. Reasons for the lower drug concentrations may be behavioral or biomedical, or a
      combination of both. While there are no systemic drug-drug interactions between TDF and oral
      contraception, there are known interactions involving these classes of medications with drug
      transporters that could affect drug concentrations in target tissues. Drug-drug interactions
      with natural estrogens and anti-androgenic agents used for gender affirming hormone therapy
      among transgender women have not been studied, neither have interactions between
      emtricitabine and female hormones. Concerns about the impact of PrEP on gender affirming
      hormone therapy is the main barrier for uptake of PrEP among transgender women. In addition,
      very little is known about TDF/FTC pharmacokinetics in transgender men using testosterone
      hormonal therapy. Drug-drug interactions with masculinizing hormones have never been properly
      investigated as trans gender men have not been formally involved in PrEP clinical trials or
      demonstrations projects.This small study will assess pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions
      between tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine and cross-sex hormone therapy. The
      I-BrEATHe study is a substudy of the Triumph study, a culturally-relevant community-led PrEP
      demonstration project in transgender communities. The I- BrEATHe pharmacokinetic substudy
      will provide Truvada daily using directly observed therapy in 24 transgender women and 24
      transgender men over a one month period, and will measure drug and hormone therapy levels in

      This study evaluates how children with Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity (ADD)
      respond to medication, and if their response is different from children who have problems
      with both hyperactivity and inattention. In order to do this, children ages 7-11 whose
      primary difficulty is with attention problems and who have never been on behavioral or
      psychiatric medications are being recruited. Once enrolled, children will try one week each
      of 3 different doses of methylphenidate, the most commonly prescribed Attention Deficit,
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication, as well as placebo. Children will be randomly
      assigned to one of six possible medication dose and placebo titration schedules, but the
      study doctor, family, and teacher will not know which dose (if any) children are receiving
      for a given week. Each week, behavioral and side effect ratings will be completed by both the
      child's parent and teacher, and the family will meet with the study doctor for a physical
      examination and to discuss how each week went. Some children will also have
      neuropsychological testing to determine how methylphenidate influences their working memory,
      sustained attention, and ability to inhibit (stop) inappropriate responses.

      All data will be analyzed to decide which medication dose the child responded to best and
      further recommendations for treatment will be given. Ultimately, this study aims to improve
      understanding of how children with ADHD-Primarily Inattentive Type respond to stimulant
      medications by

        -  determining whether these children experience a diminished response to methylphenidate
           compared to children with both hyperactivity and inattention

        -  determining whether certain genetic and environmental factors play a role in this
           response.

      Findings from this study will be used to help streamline the identification of the most
      effective doses of medication for children with ADHD-Primarily Inattentive Type.

             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          9. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational product.

         12. Positive urine drug screen (UDS) for substances of abuse at each admission in
             Qualification and Treatment Phase, excluding tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). If a
             participant presents with a positive UDS excluding THC at any admission or any visit,
             the investigator, at his/her discretion, may reschedule a repeat of UDS until the UDS
             is negative, excluding THC, before the participate is permitted to participate in any
             phase of the study.

         13. Unable to abstain from using THC during the Qualification and Treatment Phase of the
             study.

         17. Participants are unable to abstain from smoking for at least 2 hours before and at
             least 8 hours after study drug administration.

         18. Screening sitting blood pressure (BP) >=140 mm Hg (systolic) or >=90 mm Hg
             (diastolic), following at least 5 minutes rest. If BP is >=140 mm Hg (systolic) or
             >=90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the
             3 BP values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Repeated BP
             tests should be spaced at least 5 minutes apart.

         19. Baseline (screening) 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically
             relevant abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study
             results (eg, baseline corrected QT (QTc) interval as determined by the Fridericia
             method (QTcF) >450 msec, complete left bundle branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute
             or indeterminate age myocardial infarction, ST T interval changes suggestive of
             myocardial ischemia, second or third degree atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious
             bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is >450
             msec, this interval should be rate corrected using the Fridericia method and the
             resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTcF exceeds 450
             msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average
             of the 3 QTcF or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.
             Computer interpreted ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading
             ECGs before excluding participants.

         20. Participants with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             screening, as assessed by the study specific laboratory and confirmed by a single

                  syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be eligible for this study
                  provided the direct bilirubin level is <= ULN.

         21. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 60 days prior to dosing.

         22. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

      Injection of OnabotulinumtoxinA (BTX-A) into the bladder is a widely used treatment option
      for patients with overactive bladder who have failed medical therapy. Urinary tract infection
      is the most common side effect of this procedure and therefore antibiotics are given around
      the time of injection in order to prevent these events. While antibiotics are commonly given
      at the time of injection, the duration of these antibiotic regimens are variable. The

      Patients with severe mental illness (SMI) die younger than persons in the general population.
      Much of the excess mortality for SMI patients is attributable to cardiovascular disease, and
      is exacerbated by treatment with second-generation antipsychotics (2GAs). Although the
      cardiovascular risks are well-known, and safe, efficacious therapy exists, few SMI patients
      receive cardiovascular prevention drugs. Care delivery fragmentation and poor patient
      adherence are central problems to reducing cardiovascular risks for patients with SMI. To
      address these problems, we propose to conduct a multi-site, open-label, randomized controlled
      trial comparing an initial treatment strategy of free, fixed-doses of two generic,
      cardiovascular prevention drugs (statins and angiotensin drugs) delivered within mental
      health clinics versus usual treatment. The study will include adult patients (18+ years old)
      with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or
      psychosis not otherwise specified (NOS) who have received 2GAs treatment within the past six
      months from within four mental health clinics in the Boston area. We have three aims: 1) to
      compare the proportions of subjects in each arm who are receiving cardiovascular drug
      treatment and are adherent to therapy during 12-months of follow-up; 2) to compare changes in
      composite (e.g., Framingham scores) and individual (e.g., lipid levels) cardiovascular risk
      factor levels using an intent-to-treat (ITT) approach; and 3) to compare risk factor levels,
      accounting for variation in adherence over time, using causal inference techniques to
      estimate the per-protocol effect of the intervention. Our three aims examine whether this low
      cost, streamlined treatment strategy increases the numbers of subjects receiving
      cardiovascular prevention therapy and improves cardiovascular risk levels. We will follow
      subjects for 12 months, and collect interview and biometric data at baseline and over the
      following 12 months. Subjects will have the option to continue for another 12 months, during
      which we will continue to collect interview and biometric data, but will not prescribe
      cardiovascular medications. This population-based initial treatment strategy could be an
      effective and efficient approach for overcoming traditional barriers to cardiovascular
      disease prevention within the SMI population. Findings from this study will inform efforts to
      improve care and outcomes, and to enhance survival for patients with severe mental illness.

      Epidurals are an effective means for providing neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia. Prior
      studies in labor epidurals have demonstrated that a programmed intermittent bolus application

      required as well as improve patient satisfaction when compared to continuous epidural
      infusions. The effects of programmed intermittent bolus of epidural local anesthetics
      compared to continuous epidural infusions in a surgical setting have yet to be elucidated.

      undergoing abdominal surgeries including colorectal, gynecologic, surgical oncology,
      urological where epidural anesthesia can be employed. The primary endpoints of the study will
      be the total local anesthetic consumption and total opioid consumption as surrogate markers
      for the quality of epidural anesthesia. Secondary endpoints are pain scores and functional
      measurements, patient satisfaction, and incidence of hypotension.

      Individuals with Late Life Depression (LLD) often have cognitive problems, particularly
      problems with memory, attention, and problem solving, all of which contribute to
      antidepressant non-response. Our group and others have shown that decreased thinking speed is
      the central cause of functional problems in patients with LLD. Similarly, decreased walking
      speed is associated with depression and carries additional risk for falls, hospitalization,
      and death. Available evidence suggests that declining functionality in the brain's dopamine
      system contributes to age-related cognitive and motor slowing. The central hypothesis of this
      R61/R33 Phased Innovation Award is that by enhancing dopamine functioning in the brain and
      improving cognitive and motor slowing, administration of carbidopa/levodopa (L-DOPA) will
      improve depressive symptoms in older adults.

      C-reactive Protein (CRP) is a peptide produced in the liver in response to inflammation.
      Elevated circulating levels of CRP are associated with heart conditions. High levels of CRP
      have also been found in patients with COPD. In some studies, steroid inhalers have reduced

      study where patients will continue their routine diabetes care and use post-meal correction
      dosages as deemed necessary for normalizing PPBG as per the protocol.

      This multi-center study will enroll 60 patients with T1D, A1c values between 6.5 to 10%. The
      patients will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to either TI or NL. Patients who are randomized
      into the NL arm will continue using their usual prandial insulin dose before meals. Patients
      who are randomized into the TI arm will be instructed to dose before the meals and take
      necessary corrections at 1- and 2-hours after meals to optimize PPBG (Table 1B). There will
      be a total of 7 study visits (screening visit, randomization visit, 2 clinic, and 3 phone
      visits). There will be a 4-week treatment comparison between TI and NL and 1-week of
      post-study follow up. (Phone visit; Figure-1). Standard lab tests (A1c, complete metabolic
      panel {CMP}, complete blood count {CBC}) will be performed at the screening visit.

      All patients will use real-time CGM (Dexcom G5Â®, San Diego, CA), which will be provided at
      the randomization visit for their day-to-day diabetes care. CGM data will be downloaded at
      every clinic visit on a secured computer. The data will be analyzed after the study for
      different primary and secondary end points. All patients will be allowed to keep the CGM
      after the study is over for their day-to-day diabetes care.

      To study the effect of ramelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist, on sleep quality, duration
      and cognitive function in cirrhotics with insomnia.

      Patients with cirrhosis have difficulties with their sleep quality, which adversely affects
      their health-related quality of life. It is assumed the sleep disturbances are related to
      hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in these patients. However, several recent reports have indicated
      that this is not a perfect concordance and that cognition is not related to sleep
      disturbance. The mechanism for this change is not clear, although there is evidence of
      melatonin-delayed phase in these patients as well as difficulties with the excretion pattern
      of cortisol. Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone produced by the stomach which stimulates the
      appetite and also has a profound effect on sleep. Our group has demonstrated a substantial
      alteration in ghrelin secretion in cirrhosis that correlates with poor slow-wave sleep. In
      healthy individuals, ghrelin injection encourages slow-wave sleep while sleep deprivation
      increases ghrelin levels. The role of ghrelin in the sleep disturbances of cirrhosis has not
      been determined. Prior studies have also lacked the use of overnight polysomnography as a
      tool and have relied on either actigraphy or questionnaires. There is a need for detailed
      mechanistic and therapeutic approaches to analyzing sleep disturbances in cirrhosis.

      Also the therapy of sleep disturbance in cirrhosis is largely empirical. Prior studies have
      evaluated hydroxyzine which runs the risk of precipitating HE. Ramelteon is a melatonin
      analog that is FDA-approved for use in insomnia and will potentially be useful to restore the
      sleep-wake cycle in cirrhosis-associated sleep disturbance.

      The investigators aim to study the impact of the FDA-approved ramelteon on the sleep quality
      (using questionnaires and sleep diaries) on these patients with cirrhosis.

      Delirium is the most often encountered psychiatric diagnosis in the general hospital, with
      incidence up to 85% in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting and with significant
      consequences on patients' morbidity and mortality. Currently, although not FDA approved,
      antipsychotics are often considered the first-line pharmacological treatment. However, there
      can be limitations to their use, including side effects or lack of efficacy. Valproic acid
      (VPA) is one of the alternatives at times used in such patients which from limited case
      series data appears to be helpful and tolerated. VPA can provide relief from agitation that
      poses a threat to the safety and recovery of the patient. Moreover, mechanistically it
      addresses the neurochemical and cellular abnormalities inherent in delirium (it has
      NMDA-antagonist, anti-dopaminergic, GABAergic,anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and histone
      deacetylase inhibitor properties, among others). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and tolerability of the VPA in the first known to us randomized controlled trial.

      The purpose of this study is to find the safest and most effective way to administer IV
      antibiotics to treat acute pulmonary exacerbations (APEs) in patients with cystic fibrosis
      (CF) that are caused by pathogens, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study will test the
      safety and effectiveness of two commonly prescribed IV antibiotics: tobramycin and colistin.
      Though regularly used, not much is known about how these drugs compare with each other in
      terms of their toxicities, both during short term treatment of an APE and after many
      treatment courses with these drugs over many years. There are currently no guidelines on the
      safest and most effective antibiotics to use when treating APEs. We will study kidney
      function, sputum cultures, and treatment outcomes in patients receiving routine
      administration of one of these two IV antibiotics. We will also test these outcomes in
      patients receiving a less frequent dosing schedule for IV colistin. The hope is that this new
      schedule for IV colistin, which is twice a day and adjusted based on blood and urine tests,
      will reduce harmful side effects, such as kidney damage, while still being a powerful
      treatment against CF microbial pathogens.

      Chronic allograft nephropathy continues to be a major cause of kidney transplant loss and
      return to dialysis. Treatment options are limited and the course of the disease tends to be

      expansion of the cortical interstitial compartment of the kidney where most of the scarring
      occurs. The drug being studied, Losartan, has proven efficacious in a number of kidney

      The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) on the neural
      and behavioral subcomponents of self-control, that is cognitive control and reward
      functioning, in adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

      The investigators hypothesize that LDX is associated with 1a) decreased task-independent
      locus coeruleus (LC) activity; 1b) increased task-related activity in LC and the cognitive
      control network; 2) increased LC connectivity with the cognitive control network and 3)
      improved task performance and self-control. The investigators will test their hypotheses on
      fMRI data with linear contrasts of voxel-wise maps of parameter estimates (in both univariate
      and connectivity analyses).

      The investigators will also assess change in brain activity with the LDX in the LC and
      ventral tegmental areas (VTA) as we hypothesize that they are altered in ADHD and related to
      cognitive control and self-control dysfunction in ADHD.

      The investigators will use a repeated-measures, between-subject design to compare the effects
      of oral once daily LDX in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial (RCT) on neural
      (fMRI) and behavioral correlates of cognitive control via a working memory and a reward -
      delay discounting task in adolescents and young adults.

      A new condition has been added which will use a within-subject comparison, cross-over design
      between a single dose of LDX versus a single dose of placebo.

      The purposes of this study include:

      To test the safety and efficacy of Lysteda in adolescent females. To learn how well Lysteda
      works in decreasing menstrual blood loss. To see if parents and children participating in
      this study think the drug is improving their quality of life.

      Dysfunctional voiding is often associated with constipation. The association of constipation
      with urologic pathologic processes has previously been described since the 1950's, but it was
      only over the past decade that clinicians have paid more attention to this relationship and
      recognized it existence with the term dysfunctional elimination syndrome (DES). This term is
      used to reflect the broad spectrum of functional disturbances that may affect the urinary
      tract including that of functional bowl disturbances and can be classified as follows:

        -  Functional disorder of filling: overactive bladder, over distention of bladder or
           insensate bladder, which may be associated with fecal impaction or rectal distention
           with infrequent bowel movements

        -  Functional disorder of emptying: over-recruitment of pelvic floor activity during
           voiding causing interrupted and/or incomplete emptying also associated with defecation
           difficulties due to non- relaxation of the puborectalis muscle, dyssynergic defecation
           or pain with defecation Several different therapeutic options have been used for
           patients with dysfunctional voiding mainly to decrease bladder outlet obstruction. These
           treatments including, alpha adrenergic antagonists, and botulinum toxin are less than
           optimum. One possible explanation for these drug failures includes the inability of
           these medications to relax the striated muscles of the pelvic floor necessary for
           voiding.

      To date there has been no data to evaluate the role of baclofen on the striated muscle of the

      Metformin, an FDA approved first-line drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has known
      beneficial effects on glucose metabolism. Evidence from animal models and in vitro studies
      suggest that in addition to its effects on glucose metabolism, metformin may influence
      metabolic and cellular processes associated with the development of age-related conditions,
      such as inflammation, oxidative damage, diminished autophagy, cell senescence and apoptosis.
      As such, metformin is of particular interest in clinical translational research in aging
      since it may influence fundamental aging factors that underlie multiple age-related
      conditions. The investigators therefore propose a pilot study to examine the effect of
      metformin treatment on the biology of aging in humans. Namely, whether treatment with
      metformin will restore the gene expression profile of older adults with impaired glucose
      tolerance (IGT) to that of young healthy subjects.

      This is a phase 4, open-label, feasibility study of extended release naltrexone (Vivitrol,
      Alkermes Pharmaceutical) and case management for treatment of alcohol use disorders in the
      ED.

      Excess alcohol use is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and contributes to a large
      number of emergency department (ED) visits. The rate of alcohol-related ED visits is
      increasing, and there is evidence that this increase may be driven by a subset of patients
      who frequently visit the ED due to an underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD). The proposed
      study will assess the feasibility of implementing a multimodal treatment for AUD in the
      emergency department for 25 patients with AUD. The rationale for including each component of
      the multimodal treatment is outlined below.

      Pharmacotherapy is recommended as the standard of care for alcohol use disorders. Of the four
      drugs approved by the FDA for treatment of alcohol use disorder, extended release naltrexone
      has been found to be superior at reducing healthcare utilization, increasing detoxification
      facility use, and reducing total cost. Fewer than 1 in 4 patients with AUD currently receives
      treatment with an FDA approved agent and use of these drugs in EDs is virtually non-existent.

      ED patients with alcohol use disorders frequently suffer from multiple medical, mental
      health, and social problems that influence their health. Providing such patients with case
      management services has shown promise in improving health related outcomes while curbing ED
      utilization and healthcare costs.

      Regardless of comorbidity, limited access to substance use and mental health services is a
      significant barrier to receiving treatment, and large disparities exist in access based on
      income level. Facilitated referrals, where a healthcare worker communicates with the patient
      and service providers and assists the patient with obtaining follow up, have been used
      effectively to improve access to specialty care after ED discharge. Case managers are
      familiar with community treatment resources and are well versed in providing facilitated
      referrals.

      The primary hypothesis is that implementing this multimodal treatment will be feasible in an
      ED setting and will reduce alcohol use. Feasibility measures (recruitment, retention,
      continuation of treatment after the trial) are the primary outcomes. The intent of the
      intervention is to change drinking behavior in a way that benefits participants' health and
      quality of life. As such, we will conduct a limited efficacy assessment. Treatment efficacy
      will be assessed by comparing alcohol consumption, quality of life, and life consequences
      related to alcohol use before and after the intervention.

      The primary efficacy outcome is change in total alcohol consumption measured by a 2 week
      timeline follow back. Change from baseline will be assessed after the 3 month intervention
      period, and at the conclusion of the study follow up period for all outcomes.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to optimize the success of external
      cephalic version (turning the baby from the outside). Attempting to turn babies in-utero is
      recommended because it may decrease the risk of needing a cesarean section for abnormal
      presentation. While the study team knows that this procedure can be effective, the study team
      still has some un-answered questions as to the best way to perform this procedure to increase
      the chance of success. Many prior studies have shown that using spinal anesthesia (a shot of
      medication placed in your back to numb and relax the abdomen) can increase the success rate
      of a version. This ultimately has led to the finding that using this anesthesia can decrease
      the rate of cesarean section. However, there have been only a small number of studies
      assessing the success rate if spinal anesthesia is used only in the event that without it
      fails. Therefore the study team is going to compare patients who receive spinal anesthesia
      with those who only receive spinal anesthesia if the procedure to turn the baby (ECV) fails
      without it.

      Corticosteroid injections are commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis. Common practice is to inject the joint with a combination of corticosteroid
      and local anesthetic, with the rationale of providing longer duration pain relief with the
      corticosteroid and immediate, though short duration relief with the anesthetic. However,
      multiple in vitro and animal studies have shown that local anesthetic may be harmful to
      chondrocytes. Despite this data, use of intra-articular anesthetic remains widespread. Many
      clinicians believe incorporating the anesthetic is important because it can provide immediate
      pain relief and facilitate patient confidence in the treatment program. However, there is no
      published data to validate this reasoning. Therefore, the anesthetic has unknown clinical
      benefit and may have adverse effects on articular cartilage. In light of this, the
      investigators question the routine use of anesthetics in joint injections. The purpose of
      this study is to compare the effects of knee joint injections using: 1) corticosteroid with
      local anesthetic versus 2) corticosteroid with normal saline.

      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a challenging medical disorder, especially in children and
      adolescents. In order to prevent the chronic complications of hyperglycemia, the maintenance
      of near-normal glycemic control must be balanced with minimizing hypoglycemia. Although many
      pediatric endocrinologists provide an ICR plan for their newly diagnosed patients with T1DM,
      fixed dosing and other forms of insulin delivery are available. This proposal is designed to
      compare children and adolescents with newly diagnosed T1DM using a fixed insulin dose for
      fixed carbohydrate mealtime regimen (FIXED group) to children and adolescents with newly
      diagnosed T1DM using an ICR with variable carbohydrate intake (ICR group) mealtime regimen.
      In addition to determining the feasibility for a subsequently larger clinical trial, the aims
      of this investigator-initiated, prospective proposal, is twofold. The first is to determine
      if the caregivers of diabetics using a fixed insulin for fixed carbohydrate regimen (FIXED
      group) experience less anxiety than the caregivers of those using an ICR with variable
      carbohydrate intake regimen (ICR group) at 1- and 4-months post-randomization. The second is
      to determine if diabetics utilizing a fixed insulin for fixed carbohydrate regimen (FIXED
      group) have decreased glycemic variability (GV) than those using an ICR with variable
      carbohydrate intake regimen (ICR group) at 1- and 4-months post-randomization.

      There is a surgical procedure to help children with intractable fecal incontinence gain
      continence for stool through construction of a tube that connects the abdominal wall to the

      In this study, brand name lamotrigine (LAMICTAL) and generic lamotrigine will be compared in
      patients with epilepsy. Both the brand name and generic lamotrigine are approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) and are commonly used to treat epilepsy. Some physicians and
      patients with epilepsy have believed that brand and generic lamotrigine have had clinically
      significant differences in efficacy and tolerability. The brand name and generic tablets have
      been shown to be the same when blood levels were measured in healthy volunteers without
      epilepsy, but these drugs have not yet been compared in patients with epilepsy. This study
      will do this comparison, by switching patients between brand and generic in a very structured
      manner, and seeing if the drugs are the same, primarily in terms of blood levels. Other
      comparisons will also be made secondarily, looking for any differences in adverse effects and
      seizure control.
