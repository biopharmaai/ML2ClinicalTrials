# A Comprehensive Guide to TrialBench: Multi-Modal AI-Ready Datasets for Clinical Trial Prediction

## 1\. Document Overview

This document delves into the specific meanings of **Features** and **Task Labels** within the datasets and tasks of **TrialBench**, open-source multi-modal AI-ready datasets for clinical trial prediction. It serves to clarify the definitions and application contexts of each field, enabling users to effectively leverage the datasets for research on crucial areas such as trial duration, patient dropout, serious adverse events, and mortality prediction. The content is organized into two distinct sections—**Feature Descriptions** and **Task Label Descriptions**—presented in tabular format for easy comparison of names and explanations.

This setup supports seamless integration with related resources like the [Trial](https://github.com/ML2Health/ML2ClinicalTrials/tree/main/Trialbench)[Bench](https://github.com/ML2Health/ML2ClinicalTrials/tree/main/Trialbench) toy samples and the [AI4](https://github.com/ML2Health/ML2ClinicalTrials/tree/main/AI4Trial)[Trial](https://github.com/ML2Health/ML2ClinicalTrials/tree/main/AI4Trial) codebase for running relevant experiments.
